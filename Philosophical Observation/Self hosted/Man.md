## **<u>Evolution</u>**

Since the very start of evolution, the general duty performed by them are related to bread winners, in simple words. At hunters & gatherers time, they used to go for hunting & fishing to bring enough food to their family. There were instances when they went for these adventures with other men too for purpose of being more aggressive to prey & defensive against threats. But all these were being done for basic human needs like food and shelter etc. They had strong determination to survive, with minimal emotional showcase.



## **<u>Intelligence</u>**

The first ancestors of humans known as "Synapsids" were generally intelligence since starting. Many species went through extinctions due to environmental & catastrophic factors, including dinosaurs which went extinct due to atmosphere corruption resulting from volcanic eruptions caused by meteors which hit the earth. But Synapsids? Humans are way more intelligent than other species as we know, specially men as seen, so were Synapsids. They were experts in learning from experience & thus escaped being food of "diapsids", the ancestors of dinosaurs. They learned how their small size will help them survive from dinosaurs. And by records, men have been more intelligent than women.



## **<u>Artificiality Of Life</u>**

We today exist by artificial means. Meaning we were not meant to actually exist, seeing the kind of plagues, historic events & natural disasters we went through, but we are alive today. We created vaccines, managed disasters, organized set of events to solve some kind of problem. These all were not natural response to catastrophic events an animal faces but artificial means which helped us survive for such a long timeline. And men were the primary contributors to the related fields.



## **<u>Contributions By Men</u>**

Not to mention that men were backbone of all that happened. Men have contributed most to the field of natural sciences, social sciences, diplomatic protocols & countless other things you can thank them for. People say that a being empathetic is a feminine nature. But being real, women have contributed way less to even matters which are concerned with empathy than "effective empathy" that men worked on. What comes to people's mind when hearing word empathy is a melancholic person crying & spreading negativity. But it is far way deviated from the truth. Empathy is definitely feeling, but not necessarily showing. And there no more positive form of empathy to feel & take action on it than sitting & crying. And we have historically seen many examples of many powerful & charismatic figures like **Mahatma Gandhi**, **Nelson Mandela** & **Martin Luther King Jr.** etc. Their empathy changed the world, unlike women who are supposed to have "empathy". Its all about taking action on your values.



## **<u>Medieval Times</u>**

During medieval times, men were at the peak of today's definition of a "masculine man". That was also the time of conservative societies all over the world. People were very emotional with religious matters & corruption started to actually take root. Most parts of the world were ruled by royal families, citizens paid taxes, there was very less openness among people etc. But sticking to the point, men were then the largely believed definition of men. In culture like in India, the groom was selected by princess as per their qualities they seem to be attractive & masculine as per them. Clearly, whether strong or not, men had to work more than women do, even now. Responsibilities of women were and are very minimal, even now.



## **<u>Modern Era</u>**

In modern era, specially after 2000s, there has been a high peak in openness of people & collective criticism of society by newer generations. These criticisms were regarding the then conservative nature of societies. But many south-Asian countries like South Korea, Japan & India still remain to be highly socialist if not conservative in nature. And this imbalance among two parties gives rise to the generation of incels. Not only incels, but also those men who become disillusioned & decide to curve away from society's central inertia by being even voluntarily celibate.



## **<u>The Disillusionment Cycle</u>**

Modern men in capitalist economic countries often criticize the social norms for their nature they tell is "imprisoning". These are generally about the corporates, female hypergamy, experiencing bad times etc. Many men even thrive on nihilism & anti-natalism, which I leave it up to people to judge if that's right or wrong. But the point is, there is quality of empathy associated with it. General female nature inertia is to give birth to the child with a male who is masculine among other available choices. Masculine qualities aren't just up to physical strength now, but also to qualities which are directly or indirectly associated with providing security to a woman & her child. Many men today see these being ethically unjust to provide someone so much & get very little in return.



## **<u>Unjust Laws</u>**

In countries like India, the laws made are very supportive of women, but dismissive of innocent men who might get succumbed by false cases. These laws enforces a female dominance over men even at situations where female are clearly wrong. Laws like dowry act, domestic violence act, rape law, marital rape law, unnatural sex accusation etc are among those. Noticed the marital rape law? A man even be accused of raping their wives, which is very non-sensical in nature. Even a woman divorced 10 years ago or girlfriends who were separated a decade ago can file a complaint which are directly related to the listed laws. This leads to even more disillusionment & resistance to coming in relationship for men.



## **<u>Pop Culture Influence</u>**

Pop culture has heavily influenced adult males, specially those who lack direction in life. This is because not having direction or being occupied already leads to getting occupied with external thoughts & ideas, no matter how non-sensical they can be. Earlier movies enforced a masculine figures where men were strong, resistance, assertive & protected others. And even villains were men there with lacking quite of empathy. But some modern movies often showcase a picture of men where they are vulnerable, face injustice, go against norms & often become villains or anti-hero for abuses of their past.



## **<u>Media Influence</u>**

Media often portrays men on the negative side & female on the positive sides despite the unclear nature of the case. So, this directly or indirectly influences the mass social inertia to by default blame males & being protective towards female. It is worth mentioning that individual personality also plays a role here. Most people learn from their past data or experiences, which can come from any source. And because most people go with the societal inertia, they learn things from their parents, where father was once at his place being told by their mother some values like "respecting woman", whether logical or not but a value. Then similarly being brainwashed now by their own mother, add the additional influence because their fathers learnt the same thing too. And because the nurturing is done by the female, it becomes more effective. This creates a foe-like force on the other half the men who are on their path of righteousness.

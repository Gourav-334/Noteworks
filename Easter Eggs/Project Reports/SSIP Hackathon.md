# Document Identification and Recognition

## **1. <u>Project Overview</u>**
The goal of this project was to develop an AI-powered system capable of identifying and recognizing text and structured data from various types of documents, such as invoices, receipts, ID cards, and forms. The system leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision techniques to automate document processing and improve accuracy.

## **3. <u>Problem Statement</u>**
Manual document processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Organizations dealing with large volumes of documents face challenges in extracting, categorizing, and analyzing data. Our solution aims to automate this process using AI, reducing human effort and improving accuracy.

---

## **4. <u>Solution Architecture</u>**
The system is divided into three main components:

1. **Document Preprocessing**
   - Image enhancement (e.g., noise reduction, skew correction).
   - Segmentation of document regions (e.g., text, tables, images).

2. **Text Recognition**
   - OCR using Tesseract and custom-trained models for improved accuracy.
   - Handwritten text recognition using deep learning models (e.g., CRNN).

3. **Data Extraction and Classification**
   - NLP for entity recognition (e.g., names, dates, amounts).
   - Classification of document types using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## **5. <u>Technologies Used</u>**
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask
- **OCR Tools**: Tesseract, EasyOCR
- **NLP Libraries**: SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## **6. <u>Key Features</u>**
1. **Multi-Document Support**: Handles invoices, receipts, ID cards, and forms.
2. **Real-Time Processing**: Processes documents in real-time with low latency.
3. **Customizable Models**: Allows users to train models for specific document types.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface for uploading and viewing processed documents.

---

## **7. <u>Challenges Faced</u>**
1. **Handwritten Text Recognition**: Achieving high accuracy for handwritten text was difficult due to variability in handwriting styles.
2. **Document Layout Variability**: Different document layouts required robust preprocessing and segmentation techniques.
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensuring sensitive data (e.g., ID cards) was handled securely.

---

## **8. <u>Results</u>**
- Achieved **95% accuracy** in text recognition for printed documents.
- Achieved **85% accuracy** for handwritten text recognition.
- Reduced document processing time by **70%** compared to manual methods.

## **9. <u>Future Improvements</u>**
1. **Enhanced Handwritten Text Recognition**: Train models on larger datasets to improve accuracy.
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Extend support for non-English documents.
3. **Cloud Integration**: Deploy the system on cloud platforms for scalability.
4. **Blockchain for Data Security**: Implement blockchain technology to enhance data security and traceability.

## **10. <u>Conclusion</u>**
Our AI-powered document identification and recognition system demonstrates the potential of AI to revolutionize document processing. By automating tedious tasks, organizations can save time, reduce errors, and focus on higher-value activities. We are excited to continue refining the system and exploring new applications.

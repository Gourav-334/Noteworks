# $\fbox{Module 3: SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICS}$

> **Purpose**  
> Explain _why_ electronic devices work by grounding electronics in solid-state physics—without drifting into material-science excess.

## 3.1 Why Semiconductors Matter

Electronics exists because certain materials allow **controlled manipulation of charge carriers**.

#### Material categories:

- **Conductors** → too many free carriers (no control)
- **Insulators** → too few carriers (no conduction)
- **Semiconductors** → carrier population is _controllable_

#### Control knobs:

- Doping
- Electric fields
- Temperature

> Control, not conduction, is the essence of electronics.

## 3.2 Atomic Bonds and Energy Bands

In solids, atoms form lattices. Individual atomic energy levels merge into **bands**.

#### Key bands:

- **Valence band** – bound electrons
- **Conduction band** – free electrons
- **Bandgap (E₉)** – forbidden energy region

Electrical behavior depends on bandgap size.

---

## 3.3 Intrinsic Semiconductors

An **intrinsic semiconductor** is a pure material (e.g., silicon).

#### Characteristics:

- Equal number of electrons and holes
- Poor conductivity at room temperature
- Conductivity increases with temperature

#### Charge carriers:

- **Electrons** (negative)
- **Holes** (absence of electrons, positive behavior)

> Holes are not particles; they are _useful abstractions_.

---

## 3.4 Extrinsic Semiconductors (Doping)

Conductivity is increased by **adding impurities**.

### N-type Semiconductor

- Dopant: pentavalent atoms (e.g., phosphorus)
- Extra electrons introduced
- **Majority carriers**: electrons

### P-type Semiconductor

- Dopant: trivalent atoms (e.g., boron)
- Creates holes
- **Majority carriers**: holes

---

## 3.5 Charge Transport Mechanisms

### Drift

- Motion due to electric field
- Dominant in circuits

### Diffusion

- Motion due to concentration gradient
- Dominant in junctions

Both occur simultaneously in real devices.

---

## 3.6 Recombination and Generation

- **Recombination**: electron fills a hole
- **Generation**: electron-hole pair created

Thermal energy continuously creates carriers.

#### Steady state:

$$ \text{Generation rate = Recombination rate} $$

---

## 3.7 Temperature Effects

#### As temperature increases:

- Carrier concentration increases
- Conductivity increases
- Leakage currents rise

#### This leads to:

- Thermal instability
- Device failure if unmanaged

> Temperature is an invisible circuit parameter.

---

## 3.8 Breakdown Concepts (Intuition Only)

When electric field becomes too strong:

- **Zener breakdown** – quantum tunneling
- **Avalanche breakdown** – impact ionization

Used deliberately in:

- Voltage regulation
- Protection circuits

---

## 3.9 Why Silicon Dominates

#### Reasons:

- Moderate bandgap
- Abundant availability
- Stable oxide (SiO₂)
- Good thermal behavior

Alternatives exist (GaAs, SiC), but silicon is optimal for general electronics.

## 3.10 Summary (Invariants of Module 3)

- Band structure defines electrical behavior
- Doping enables control
- Both electrons and holes matter
- Temperature always affects devices

> Semiconductor physics explains _everything that follows_.

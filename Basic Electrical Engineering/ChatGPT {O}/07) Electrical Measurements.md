# $\fbox{Module 7: ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS}$

> **Purpose**  
> Understand how electrical quantities are measured accurately, what errors arise, and how instruments influence the circuits they measure.

---

## 7.1 Why Measurement Matters

Engineering decisions rely on **measured values**.

#### Poor measurement leads to:

- Wrong conclusions
- Equipment damage
- Inefficient operation

> Measurement is not passive — instruments interact with circuits.

---

## 7.2 Types of Measuring Instruments

#### Based on indication:

- **Indicating** – show instantaneous value
- **Recording** – record variation with time
- **Integrating** – totalize quantity over time (e.g., energy meters)

---

## 7.3 Analog vs Digital Instruments

### Analog Instruments

- Continuous indication
- Limited precision
- Subject to parallax error

### Digital Instruments

- Discrete numerical output
- Higher accuracy
- Minimal reading error

---

## 7.4 Measurement of Current

- Measured using **ammeter**
- Connected **in series** with the load
- Ammeter has **very low internal resistance**

#### Why low resistance:

- To avoid altering circuit current

---

## 7.5 Measurement of Voltage

- Measured using **voltmeter**
- Connected **in parallel** with the component
- Voltmeter has **very high internal resistance**

#### Why high resistance:

- To avoid drawing current

---

## 7.6 Measurement of Power

- Measured using **wattmeter**

#### Uses:

- Current coil (series)
-  Voltage coil (parallel)

Measures **real power only**.

---

## 7.7 Instrument Transformers

Used for high voltage/current systems:

- **CT (Current Transformer)**
- **PT (Potential Transformer)**

#### Functions:

- Scale down quantities
- Provide isolation
- Improve safety

---

## 7.8 Errors in Measurement

#### Types of errors:

- Instrumental errors
- Environmental errors
- Observational errors

Errors cannot be eliminated, only minimized.

---

## 7.9 Loading Effect

Connecting an instrument changes circuit behavior.

#### Examples:

- Voltmeter draws current → voltage drops
- Ammeter adds resistance → current reduces

> Good instruments minimize loading.

---

## 7.10 Accuracy, Precision, and Sensitivity

- **Accuracy** – closeness to true value
- **Precision** – repeatability
- **Sensitivity** – response per unit input

These are independent properties.

---

## 7.11 Energy Measurement

Electrical energy is measured in:

- **$kWh$ (units)**

Energy meter integrates power over time.

---

## 7.12 Summary (Module 7)

- Instruments affect what they measure
- Proper connection is critical
- Errors are unavoidable but controllable
- Measurement completes the engineering loop

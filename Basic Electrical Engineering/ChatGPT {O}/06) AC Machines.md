## 6.1 Why AC Machines Dominate

AC machines are preferred because they:

- Are **rugged and low-maintenance**
- Do not require commutators or brushes
- Integrate naturally with AC power systems

The induction motor is the **industrial workhorse**.

---

## 6.2 Rotating Magnetic Field (Core Idea)

When balanced AC currents flow in stator windings:

- Magnetic fields combine
- A **rotating magnetic field (RMF)** is produced

This rotating field is the foundation of all AC machines.

---

## 6.3 Synchronous Speed

Speed of rotating magnetic field:

$$ N_s = \frac{120 f}{P} $$

#### Where:

- $f$ = Supply frequency ($Hz$)
- $P$ = Number of poles

All AC machines reference this speed.

---

## 6.4 Induction Motor — Principle of Operation

#### In an induction motor:

- RMF cuts rotor conductors
- EMF is induced in rotor
- Rotor currents flow
- Interaction with RMF produces **torque**

Rotor current exists only if there is **relative speed**.

---

## 6.5 Slip (Essential Concept)

#### Slip defines speed difference:

$$ s = \frac{N_s - N_r}{N_s} $$

#### Where:

- $Ns$ = synchronous speed
- $Nr$ = rotor speed

#### Slip:

- Zero at synchronous speed
- Required for torque production

---

## 6.6 Why Rotor Never Reaches Synchronous Speed

If rotor speed is same as synchronous speed:

- No relative motion
- No induced EMF
- No rotor current
- No torque

So induction motors **always run slightly below $Ns$**.

---

## 6.7 Types of Induction Motors

#### Based on rotor construction:

- **Squirrel-cage** (robust, low cost)
- **Slip-ring** (high starting torque, control)

Both use the same operating principle.

---

## 6.8 Torque–Slip Characteristic

- Torque increases with slip
- Maximum torque at pull-out point
- Beyond this → motor stalls

This curve defines motor performance.

---

## 6.9 Losses in Induction Motors

- Stator copper losses
- Rotor copper losses
- Core losses
- Mechanical losses

Efficiency is high at rated load.

---

## 6.10 Synchronous Machines (Introduction)

#### In synchronous machines:

- Rotor field locks with RMF
- Rotor speed = synchronous speed
- No slip in steady operation

#### Used as:

- Alternators
- Synchronous motors

## 6.11 Comparison: Induction vs Synchronous

| Feature    | Induction         | Synchronous       |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Slip       | Required          | Zero              |
| Starting   | Self-starting     | Not self-starting |
| Speed      | Slightly below Ns | Exactly Ns        |
| Complexity | Low               | Higher            |

---

## 6.12 Applications

- Induction motors: fans, pumps, conveyors
- Synchronous machines: power generation, power factor control

---

## 6.13 Summary (Module 6)

- RMF is the heart of AC machines
- Induction motors rely on slip
- Synchronous machines run at $Ns$
- AC machines dominate modern industry

> Establish the physical and mathematical foundations of alternating current (AC) systems used in power, machines, and measurements.

## 1.1 Why AC Exists

#### AC is used because it:

- Enables **efficient voltage transformation** (via transformers)
- Reduces **transmission losses** over long distances
- Is naturally produced by rotating electrical machines

AC is not “better” than DC universally; it is **better for power systems**.

---

## 1.2 Sinusoidal Quantities

An AC quantity varies periodically with time.

#### Standard form:

$$ v(t) = V_m \sin(\omega t + \phi) $$

#### Where:

- ($V_m$): peak value
- ($\omega = 2\pi f$): angular frequency
- ($f$): frequency ($Hz$)
- ($\phi$): phase angle

---

## 1.3 Cycle, Frequency, and Time Period

- **One cycle**: one complete repetition of waveform
- **Frequency ($f$)**: cycles per second (Hz)
- **Time period ($T$)**: time for one cycle

#### Relationship:  
$$ T = \frac{1}{f} $$

---

## 1.4 Average and RMS Values

### Average Value

- Average of a sinusoid over one full cycle is $0$.
- Used mainly for rectified waveforms.

### RMS (Root Mean Square) Value

RMS represents the **DC-equivalent heating effect**.

#### For a sine wave:  
$$ V_{rms} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}} $$

Power calculations in AC **always use RMS values**.

---

## 1.5 Phase and Phase Difference

- **Phase** indicates the relative position in a cycle
- **Phase difference** shows lead or lag between quantities

#### Examples:

- Current **lags** voltage in inductive circuits
- Current **leads** voltage in capacitive circuits

Phase relationships determine **power behavior**.

---

## 1.6 Phasor Concept

A **phasor** is a rotating vector representing:

- Magnitude (length)
- Phase angle (orientation)

#### Key idea:

> Time-varying sinusoids can be analyzed as **stationary vectors** in steady state.

Phasors simplify AC circuit analysis by removing time dependence.

---

## 1.7 Phasor Representation Rules

- All phasors rotate at the **same angular speed**
- Relative angles carry physical meaning
- Calculations use **complex numbers**

Sinusoids of the same frequency → one phasor plane.

---

## 1.8 Instantaneous vs Steady-State Analysis

- **Instantaneous analysis**: time-domain, differential equations
- **Steady-state AC analysis**: phasor-domain, algebraic equations

BEE focuses primarily on **steady-state AC behavior**.

---

## 1.9 Key Invariants of AC Systems

- Frequency is common to the entire interconnected system
- RMS values determine heating and power
- Phase determines power flow efficiency

---

## 1.10 Summary (Module 1)

- AC quantities are sinusoidal and periodic
- RMS is the meaningful magnitude for power
- Phase relationships matter
- Phasors convert time problems into geometry

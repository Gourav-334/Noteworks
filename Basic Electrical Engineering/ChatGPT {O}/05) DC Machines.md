> **Purpose**
> Understand how electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy (motor action) and mechanical energy to electrical energy (generator action) using DC machines.

## 5.1 Why DC Machines Matter

#### DC machines:

- Provide the **clearest physical insight** into electromechanical energy conversion
- Are conceptually simpler than AC machines
- Form the foundation for understanding torque, EMF, and commutation

Even though modern systems use AC machines, DC machines are the **learning reference model**.

## 5.2 Basic Construction of a DC Machine

#### Main parts:

- **Stator (Field system)** – produces magnetic field
- **Rotor (Armature)** – carries current and rotates
- **Commutator** – mechanical rectifier
- **Brushes** – provide electrical contact

The machine is symmetrical for motor and generator operation.

## 5.3 Principle of Operation (Lorentz Force)

When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field:

- It experiences a **force**

Direction given by Fleming’s rules.
This force on multiple conductors produces **torque**.

---

## 5.4 Motor Action (Electrical → Mechanical)

#### In a DC motor:

- Electrical current flows in armature conductors
- Magnetic field interacts with current
- Net force produces **rotation**

#### Speed adjusts until:

- Electromagnetic torque balances load torque

---

## 5.5 Generator Action (Mechanical → Electrical)

#### In a DC generator:

- Armature rotates mechanically
- Conductors cut magnetic flux
- **EMF is induced** (Faraday’s law)

Direction determined by Fleming’s right-hand rule.

## 5.6 Back EMF (Key Concept)

#### As a motor rotates:

- It generates an EMF opposite to supply
- Called **back EMF**

#### Back EMF:

- Limits armature current
- Provides automatic speed regulation

---

## 5.7 EMF Equation (Conceptual)

#### Generated EMF depends on:

- Flux per pole
- Speed of rotation
- Number of conductors

More speed → more EMF.

---

## 5.8 Types of DC Machines

Based on field excitation:

- **Shunt**
- **Series**
- **Compound**

Each type has different speed–torque characteristics.

---

## 5.9 Losses in DC Machines

- Copper losses ($I^2R$)
- Iron losses (hysteresis, eddy currents)
- Mechanical losses (friction, windage)

Losses reduce efficiency and cause heating.

---

## 5.10 Efficiency and Performance

#### Efficiency:

$$ \eta = \frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Input}} $$

DC machines offer good controllability but higher maintenance.

---

## 5.11 Why DC Machines Are Being Replaced

- Brushes cause wear and sparking
- Maintenance intensive
- AC machines + power electronics are superior

Concepts remain **fundamental and reusable**.

---

## 5.12 Summary (Module 5)

- DC machines convert electrical ↔ mechanical energy
- Torque comes from current–field interaction
- Back EMF governs current and speed
- Types differ by field connection

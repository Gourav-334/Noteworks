## **<u>Evolution</u>**

Since the very starting of paleolithic era, the primary role of a female was of a nurturer & caretaker of the baby. This role was pivotal for proper and healthy growth of the baby. As men were the providers of bread & protectors of family, females were the nurturers for the kid.



## **<u>Intelligence</u>**

While men were the more intelligent beings, women on the other side are more of an emotional beings. When it comes to reasoning, men are more open to accept facts that are true & engage in logical debates (in today's world). Women however on the other side, may not openly accept facts that are true if they don't align with their inner values or emotional wavelengths. They are more reactive to situations involving emotional response, whether sentimental or sensory. Women have statistically more mood swings than men & are more sensitive in that sense.



## **<u>Artificiality Of Life</u>**

While we are alive by artificial means already with men contributing to many fields. There are also contributions towards some fields which are not necessity means to survive. These might include plastic surgery & other medical artificial means to enhance (in one's eyes) their looks. More than men, women have been the main party demanding for such things. Women are more body conscious by their evolutionary nature, naturally having such demands. Not to mention that some men also have those requirements but very less when compared to the larger dominating fraction.



## **<u>Contribution By Women</u>

While men were & still are dominant of scientific fields, women are more inclined towards fields related to nurturing or taking care. These include house maids, nurses, activists etc. While it was mentioned previously that men have more effective empathy, there are also some examples of effective empathy by women around the world, you name it. Not being visible to the world doesn't always mean not contributing. For women, these contributions are more related to helping children grown through nurturing. But sadly, these roles have been corrupted. In eastern civilization, women often "tiger parent" their children to fulfill their (that woman's) dreams, which she aspired but didn't achieved. And in western world, adultery & divorces has become very common among people, leading to negligence of children, destroying the purity of the role.

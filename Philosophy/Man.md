## **<u>Evolution</u>**

Since the very start of evolution, the general duty performed by them are related to bread winners, in simple words. At hunters & gatherers time, they used to go for hunting & fishing to bring enough food to their family. There were instances when they went for these adventures with other men too for purpose of being more aggressive to prey & defensive against threats. But all these were being done for basic human needs like food and shelter etc. They had strong determination to survive, with no emotional showcase.



## **<u>Intelligence</u>**

The first ancestors of humans known as "Synapsids" were generally intelligence since starting. Many species went through extinctions due to environmental & catastrophic factors, including dinosaurs which went extinct due to atmosphere corruption resulting from volcanic eruptions caused by meteors which hit the earth. But Synapsids? Humans are way more intelligent than other species as we know, specially men as seen, so were Synapsids. They were experts in learning from experience & thus escaped being food of "diapsids", the ancestors of dinosaurs. They learned how their small size will help them survive from dinosaurs.



## **<u>Artificiality Of Life</u>**

We today exist by artificial means. Meaning we were not meant to actually exist, seeing the kind of plagues, historic events & natural disasters we went through, but we are alive today. We created vaccines, managed disasters, organized set of events to solve some kind of problem. These all were not natural response to catastrophic events an animal faces but artificial means which helped us survive for such a long timeline.



## **<u>Contributions By Men</u>**

Not to mention that men were backbone of all that happened. Men have contributed most to the field of natural sciences, social sciences, diplomatic protocols & countless other things you can thank them for. People say that a being empathetic is a feminine nature. But being real, women have contributed way less to even matters which are concerned with empathy than "effective empathy" that men worked on. What comes to people's mind when hearing word empathy is a melancholic person crying & spreading negativity. But it is far way deviated from the truth. Empathy is definitely feeling, but not necessarily showing. And there no more positive form of empathy to feel & take action on it than sitting & crying. And we have historically seen many examples of many powerful & charismatic figures like **Mahatma Gandhi**, **Nelson Mandela** & **Martin Luther King Jr.** etc. Their empathy changed the world, unlike women who are supposed to have "empathy". Its all about taking action on your values.

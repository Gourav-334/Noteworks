# $\fbox{Chapter 2: CLASSICAL ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES}$





## **Topic - 1: Symmetric Cipher Model (SCM)**

- SCM uses a secret key that is common to both sender & receiver.
- If a strong algorithm is used with a key, it would be difficult for someone to sniff.
- We assume that cipher, algorithm & key is known.


## **Topic - 2: Cryptanalysis & Brute Force Attack**

### <u>Brute Force Attack</u>

- In **brute force attack**, primary objective of attacker is to get key.
- And secondary objective is to directly get message.
- They brute force on ciphertext with various keys until an intelligible message is derived.


### <u>Cryptanalyst Attack</u>

- In **cryptanalyst attack**, the cryptanalysts suggests how to hack traffic & modify texts.
- It can happen at different levels, including when cryptanalysts have knowledge about both ciphertext & key.


### <u>Substitution Technique</u>

- In **substitution technique**, each letter in plaintext is replaced with other characters/ numbers/ symbols.

#### Types:

- Caesar cipher
- Monoalphabetic cipher
- Playfair cipher
- Hill cipher
- Polyalphabetic cipher
- One-time pad

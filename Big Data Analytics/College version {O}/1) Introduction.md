## **Topic - 1: Introduction To Data**

### <u>Data</u>

- **<u>Data</u>:** Any kind of figure/quantity/symbols stored on storage devices.


### <u>Types Of Data</u>

1. **<u>Quantitative data</u>:** Numerical data
2. **<u>Qualitative data</u>:** Descriptive data

#### Quantitative data:

1. **<u>Discrete data</u>:** Countable data
2. **<u>Continuous data</u>:** Measurable data



## **Topic - 2: Introduction To Big Data**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- **<u>Big data</u>:** Data which together occupy size in petabytes (PBs).

>**<u>NOTE</u>:**
>$90\%$ of total data available today is generated in last $3$ years!


### <u>Sources Of Big Data</u>

- Social media
- Traffic data
- GPS signal
- Emails, blogs & articles
- Software logs
- Weather stations & satellite
- Media files on internet


### <u>Big Data Characteristics</u>

1. **<u>Volume</u>:** In petabytes (PBs).
2. **<u>Value</u>:** Using data as valuable insights for real-world application.
3. **<u>Veracity</u>:** Unpredictability & inefficiencies in available data.
4. **<u>Visualization</u>:** Representing data in any visual form.
5. **<u>Variety</u>:** Composition of various forms of data at single place.
6. **<u>Valocity</u>:** Rate of growth of data.
7. **<u>Virality</u>:** Rate of spread of data.


### <u>Variety</u>

- Variety not in just terms of heterogeneous sources but structure too.
- This also includes data from various file formats.
- One major challenge is to manipulate such a large amount of data altogether.


### <u>Veracity</u>

- Veracity can be handled if there is hygiene in data.
- Its not just about unhygienic data but also about trustworthiness of sources from where its gathered.


### <u>Velocity</u>

- New data before being analyzed, are warehoused.
- But need for real-time processing is increasing to mitigate storage shortage due to warehousing.
- Real-time processing helps in analyzing data as it comes.


### <u>Value</u>

- Value is the end goal of organizations.
- It is about generating revenue by the insights gathered through analysis of data.



## **Topic - 3: Challenges Of Conventional System**

### <u>Major Problems</u>

1. Volume of data
2. Processing & analyzing
3. Management of data

# $\fbox{Chapter 2: HADOOP}$





## **Topic - 1: History Of Hadoop**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Hadoop is an open-source framework by ****Apache Software Foundation***.
- It can store & process large datasets, up to multiple petabytes.
- In 2008, Hadoop defeated supercomputers & became fastest system for sorting terabytes of data.
- Hadoop allows for parallel processing of data.


### <u>Components Of Hadoop</u>

1. **<u>HDFS</u>:** Hadoop Distributed File System
2. **<u>Yarn</u>:** For managing resources.


### <u>Basics Of Hadoop</u>

- Hadoop stores data in clusters & is based on concept of **data locality**.
- **<u>Data locality</u>:** A concept in which computational data are sent to cluster nodes.
- And it runs applications by dividing among hardware resources.
- With high processing power, it can handle theoretically unlimited tasks/jobs.
- This computational logic is written & compiled in Java.


### <u>Advantages Of Hadoop</u>

- Various data sources
- Cost-effective
- Performance
- Fault-tolerant
- Highly available
- Low network traffic
- High throughput

>**<u>TIPS</u>:**
>Write anything except disadvantages as advantage, it would be right.


### <u>Disadvantages Of Hadoop</u>

- Issue with small files
- Vulnerable by nature
- Processing overhead
- Only batch processing
- Iterative processing
- Security issues

>**<u>FACT</u>:**
>Notice how *vulnerable* & *security* are written as two separate points. It's a hack.

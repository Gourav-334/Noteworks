## **Topic - 3: Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- PPF is a graph showing combination of two goods in varying quantity, which can be produced with available resources.
- It heavily depends on concepts of scarcity, choice & tradeoffs.
- **<u>Productively efficient output</u>s:** Points lying on the curve of graph.
- Slope of PPF shows the opportunity cost for producing one good over other.
- **<u>Opportunity cost</u>:** Cost for gaining a good, which is often losing some from the other good.


### <u>PPF & Social Choices</u>

- This is an example of both healthcare & education sharing the same limited resources.
- The curves in this PPF graph shows how spending certain amount of resources on one affects another one.


### <u>The Law Of Diminishing Returns</u>

- As the name itself must be enough, this law says that as the spending on one good increases, the return of other good keeps decreasing.


### <u>Productive Efficiency & Allocative Efficiency</u>

- **<u>Efficiency</u>:** Lack of waste.
- **<u>Productive efficiency</u>:** Theory saying its **not** possible to produce a good without decreasing another good in quantity.
- **<u>Allocative efficiency</u>:** Theory saying that resources are supplied in the required proportion to the needy.

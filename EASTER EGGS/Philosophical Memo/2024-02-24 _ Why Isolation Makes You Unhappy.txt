WHY ISOLATION MAKES YOU UNHAPPY
-------------------------------

Main
----
We always, knowingly or unknowingly relate to a movie character, and want to align with the experiences of its character. When we receive a common experience, it kicks the dopamine and we feel relatable; and a connection is established between the character and us. This tries to eradicate our loneliness, which drives the person to have social interactions; as there is never only one character in the entire movie. And when doing so, we feel complete; until we face something which breaks us down. It can be anything starting from an encounter from a rude person to realising the corrupt nature of the authority.

But in isolation, we barely can connect to anyone where social interaction is very low, or no interaction at all. And therefore, with a lack of connection we become unhappy due to the way we have evolved since now. And even some people may lose the confidence and assertiveness as isolation duration increases, despite how a person used to behave in a social setting. But with this, a benefit is freedom from societal expectations and shackles of modern world. The solution to this is to stay physically and spiritually active while also practicing constant conversations inorder to not lose the social charm. Isolation also provides a positive and safe space for scientific and philosophical pursuits and explorations.

There is one thing that no one talks about. That whether one stays isolated or socially connected, has direct effects on individual's body and level on consciousness. A person will feel more conscious when socially connected because your mind is in a constant state of being ready for adversity arising from threat from a person/ people around you, no matter how close or trustable they are, its a natural response of the mind and body; which is result of human evolution. However, there is no threat from a living being when someone is in isolation, to which a person's mind and body becomes accustomed to; and he starts getting used to not feeling fully conscious. This problem can be solved by staying in constant touch of nature, feeling it with senses; and also bear pain through physical training and performing chores, when isolated.

A person behaves as himself when alone, contrary to forced and fake subconscious image formed by him to fit in. Not only this, the individual takes a big pride in feeling his own authenticity in an authentic way, unlike taking pride in identity when others perceive you as a superior person. And a positive environment is established. Add a few more routinal tasks like connecting with God through meditation and reading scriptures.

After certain period of isolation, a person starts thinking about the goods done by the society, friends, teachers etc to him who praised, helped or motivated him in past. This occurs even if it was a small fraction of the whole experience, contrary to the larger bad experience. This force acts as a honey trap for the person to pull him out of the isolation. A wise person must not get overwhelmed by this, knowing the truth.

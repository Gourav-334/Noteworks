### <u>Formula</u>

$$ Efficiency\;=\;Rate\;of\;work\;=\;\frac{Work}{Time\;taken} $$


### <u>Work Ratio</u>

- Let $X:Y$ be the ratio of people to be evaluated for doing a certain job.
- Then the time they will take for the job will be in ratio $Y:X$.
- Also, if $x_1$ people can do $W_1$ work in $D_1$ days in $T_1$ hours each day & similarly $x_2$...

$$ \frac{x_1\;\times\;D_1\;\times\;T_1}{W_1}\;=\;\frac{x_2\;\times\;D_2\;\times\;T_2}{W_2} $$


### <u>Team Work</u>

- Suppose $A$ can complete a work in $x$ days & $B$ can complete the same work in $y$ days.
- And both work together to complete the work faster.
- Then work done by $A$ in one day is $\frac{1}{x}$ & that by $B$ is $\frac{1}{y}$.
- Thus, total work done by them:

$$ \frac{1}{x}\;+\;\frac{1}{y}\;=\;\frac{x\;+\;y}{xy} $$

- In such situations, we assume the work to be $1$ & then calculate the efficiency.

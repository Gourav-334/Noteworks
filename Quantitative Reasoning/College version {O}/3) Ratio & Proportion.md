# $\fbox{Chapter 3: RATIO \& PROPORTION}$





## **Topic - 1: Types Of Ratio**

- **<u>Duplicate ratio</u>:** Ratio of squares of two numbers.
- **<u>Triplicate ratio</u>:** Ratio of cubes of two numbers.
- **<u>Sub-duplicate ratio</u>:** Ratio of square roots of two numbers.
- **<u>Inverse ratio</u>:** Reciprocal ratio
- **<u>Compound ratio</u>:** Product of multiple ratios.



## **Topic - 2: Proportion**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- **<u>Proportion</u>:** Equality of two ratios.

$$ a:b\;=\;c:d $$
$$ a:b::c:d $$


### <u>Types Of Proportions</u>

- **<u>Fourth proportional</u>:** In a equation where $a:b\;=\;c:d$, $d$ is the fourth proportional.
- **<u>Third proportional</u>:** In a equation where $a:x\;=\;x:b$, $b$ is the third proportional.
- **<u>Mean proportional</u>:** In a equation where $a:x\;=\;x:b$, $x$ is the mean proportional.



## **Topic - 3: Percentage**

### <u>Consumption Increase/Decrease</u>

#### Increase in price:

- If increase is price of a commodity is $R\%$, then percentage reduction in consumption is as shown below.

$$ [\frac{R}{100+R}\times100]\;\% $$

- Typical questions are like if $A$ is $R\%$ more than $B$, then $B$ is $\_$ less than $A$.

#### Decrease in price:

- And when the price reduces, increase in consumption is as shown below.

$$ [\frac{R}{100-R}\times100]\;\% $$

- Typical questions are like if $A$ is $R\%$ less than $B$, then $B$ is $\_$ more than $A$.

### <u>Compound Interest</u>

- **<u>Compound interest</u>:** An interest where the rate increases increases each year at constant rate.

#### Interest after $n$ years:

$$ P\;(1\;+\;\frac{R}{100})^{n} $$

#### Interest before $n$ years:

$$ \frac{P}{(1\;+\;\frac{R}{100})^{n}} $$


### <u>Negative Compound Interest</u>

#### Interest after $n$ years:

$$ P\;(1\;-\;\frac{R}{100})^{n} $$

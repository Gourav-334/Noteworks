## **Topic - 1: Time & Work**

### <u>Formula</u>

$$ Efficiency\;=\;Rate\;of\;work\;=\;\frac{Work}{Time\;taken} $$


### <u>Work Ratio</u>

- Let $X:Y$ be the ratio of people to be evaluated for doing a certain job.
- Then the time they will take for the job will be in ratio $Y:X$.
- Also, if $x_1$ people can do $W_1$ work in $D_1$ days in $T_1$ hours each day & similarly $x_2$...

$$ \frac{x_1\;\times\;D_1\;\times\;T_1}{W_1}\;=\;\frac{x_2\;\times\;D_2\;\times\;T_2}{W_2} $$


### <u>Team Work</u>

- Suppose $A$ can complete a work in $x$ days & $B$ can complete the same work in $y$ days.
- And both work together to complete the work faster.
- Then work done by $A$ in one day is $\frac{1}{x}$ & that by $B$ is $\frac{1}{y}$.
- Thus, total work done by them:

$$ \frac{1}{x}\;+\;\frac{1}{y}\;=\;\frac{x\;+\;y}{xy} $$

- In such situations, we assume the work to be $1$ & then calculate the efficiency.



## **Topic - 2: Pipes & Cisterns**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Pipes & cisterns problems are related to filling volumes & emptying them.
- **<u>Inlet</u>:** Pipe which is used for filling a volume (positive work done).
- **<u>Outlet</u>:** Pipe which is used for emptying a volume (negative work done).
- Outlet is also sometimes known as leak.


### <u>Formula</u>

- Let's say that it takes $x$ hours for a tank to fill or empty.
- Then the part of tank filled/emptied in $1$ hour is $\frac{1}{x}$.



## **Topic - 3: Speed, Distance & Time**

### <u>Conversion</u>

$$ x\;km/hrs\;=\;x\;\times\;\frac{5}{18}\;m/sec $$
$$ x\;m/sec\;=\;x\;\times\;\frac{18}{5}\;km/hrs $$
$$ 1\;mile\;=\;1.609\;km $$
$$ 1\;mile\;=\;1760\;yards $$
$$ 1\;yard\;=\;3\;feet $$


### <u>Meeting Point Questions</u>

- These questions are about people starting from certain point & meeting at another point.
- If they start together, then the time taken by them to meet each other is same (obviously).
- If they meet each other again by going back to their point & coming back, then distance the second time is $3d$.
- Then third time it will be $5d$.


### <u>Relative Speed</u>

- Physics formulae might be used.

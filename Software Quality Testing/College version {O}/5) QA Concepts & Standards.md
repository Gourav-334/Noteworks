# $\fbox{Chapter 5: QA CONCEPTS \& STANDARDS}$





## **Topic - 1: Quality Concepts**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Software quality is a set of characteristics to rank products.
- Quality defined through multiple models since 1970s.
- Early metrics (McCall) became obsolete.


### <u>Parameters Influencing Quality</u>

- Products
- Processes
- Resources



## **Topic - 2: Quality Control (QC)**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Ensures consistency in end products.
- Focuses on outcome (not process).


### <u>Steps</u>

1. Plan (design QM processes)
2. Do (apply production parameters)
3. Check (verify compliance)
4. Act (corrective steps if required)



## **Topic - 3: Quality Assurance (QA)**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Positive statement ensuring trust in product/service.
- Focuses on **process improvement**.
- Covers all phases (requirements $\rightarrow$ coding $\rightarrow$ release).
- **Standards -** ISO 9000, CMMI, ISO 15504, etc.


### <u>SQA Activities</u>

1. SQA Plan
2. Define checkpoints
3. Apply engineering techniques
4. Formal reviews
5. Multi-testing strategy
6. Enforce process adherence
7. Change control & impact analysis
8. SQA audits
9. Maintain records & reports



## **Topic - 4: Software Reviews**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Team activity to evaluate product for approval/comments.
- Increases clarity, detects issues early, reduces cost, etc.


### <u>Types</u>

- Code review
- Pair programming
- Inspection (structured defect search)
- Walkthrough (group discussion)


### <u>Formal Technical Reviews (FTR)</u>

- **Goals -** Uncover errors, enforce standards, verify requirements, etc.
- **Roles -** Moderator, Author, Reader, Reviewer, Recorder, etc.
- Pre-meeting preparation essential.



## **Topic - 5: Software Reliability**

- Probability software works without failure for given environment/time.
- **Attributes -** Accuracy, error avoidance, recovery, sophistication
- Different from hardware (no aging or wear-out).



## **Topic - 6: Software Safety**

- Ensures software runs safely in normal & abnormal conditions.
- **Safety-critical domains -** Aerospace (DO-178C), automotive (ISO 26262), nuclear, railways, etc.
- Includes hazard analysis, safety constraints, predictable failure handling, etc.



## **Topic - 7: Quality Assurance Standards**

### <u>ISO Standards</u>

- **ISO 9000 -** Framework for quality systems.
- **ISO 9001 -** Applicable to most software organizations.
- **ISO 9126 -** defines 6 quality factors.


### <u>ISO 9126 Six Factors</u>

- Functionality
- Reliability
- Usability
- Efficiency
- Maintainability
- Portability



## **Topic - 8: Capability Maturity Model (CMM)**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Developed by SEI (1987).
- Defines 5 maturity levels.


### <u>5 Maturity Levels</u>

1. Initial (ad hoc)
2. Repeatable (basic PM policies)
3. Defined (standardized processes)
4. Managed (quantitative control)
5. Optimizing (continuous improvement)



## **Topic - 9: Total Quality Management (TQM)**

- **Philosophy -** Continuous improvement & customer satisfaction
- **Principles -** Customer focus, leadership, engagement, process approach, continual improvement, evidence-based decisions, relationship management, etc.
- For example, ***Toyotaâ€™s Kanban system***.
- **Tool -** ReQtest (for test, requirement, bug management, etc).



## **Topic - 10: Six Sigma**

- Data-driven methodology for near-zero defects.
- **Goals -** Process improvement, defect reduction, cost reduction, etc.
- **Key concepts -**  CTQ, defects, process capability, variation, stability, design for Six Sigma, etc.
- **Tools -** Process mapping, Pareto analysis, Hypothesis testing, DOE, SPC, etc.



## **Topic - 11: SPICE (ISO/IEC 15504)**

- Software Process Improvement & Capability Determination
- **Categories -** Customer-supplier, engineering, management, support, organization, etc.
- Defines basic & generic practices for process assessment and improvement.



## **Topic - 12: SQA Metrics**

- Evaluate software product, process, project, etc.
- **Product metrics -** Size, complexity, performance.
- **Process metrics -** Defect detection/removal time, response time.
- **Project metrics -** Team size, cost, duration.

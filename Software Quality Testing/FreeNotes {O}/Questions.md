#### Q1: What is black-box testing?
- Black-box testing is a non-functional testing method.
- It is performed by the tester.
- The tester may or may not have technical knowledge about the test subject.
- These are mostly performed on graphical interfaces.

#### Q2: What is white-box testing?
- White box testing is a form of functional testing method.
- It is performed by both developer.
- The developer must be directly involved in the technical aspects of the project.

#### Q3: What is grey-box testing?
- Grey-box testing is a form of function testing method.
- It can be performed by both tester & developer.
- If performed by tester, the tester must have some technical idea about test subject.

#### Q4: What is loop testing?
- Loop testing is a form of functional testing.
- This testing is performed specifically on programming loops.
- It checks if the loops work as intended.
- This might include checking consistency in value & program's stage.

#### Q5: What is cyclometric complexity?
- Cyclometric complexity is a testing method used in white-box testing.
- It combines CFD representation & formulae to predict complexity of a program.

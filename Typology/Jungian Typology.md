## 2. Token Definitions


### 2.1 <u>Information</u>:

- **<u>Sensing (S)</u>:** Perceiving physical world as it is through 5 senses.
- **<u>Intuiting (N)</u>:** Perceiving physical world in form of discrete patterns, which are missed by senses.
- **<u>Feeling (F)</u>:** Taking decisions as per emotional influence.
- **<u>Thinking (T)</u>:** Taking decisions as per logical reasoning.


### 2.2 <u>Energy Direction</u>:

- **<u>Introversion (I)</u>:** Pulling in & internally processing/reflecting on meta (N/T) or human (S/F) information, refined by personally experienced data.
- **<u>Extroversion (E)</u>:** Projecting out & externally processing/representing meta (N/T) or human (S/F) information, refined by impersonal objective data.


### 2.3 <u>Target Attributes</u>:

- Base of decision making
- Topics for casual discussion
- Job feedback with reason
- Natural hobby



## 3. Singular Jungian Definition


- ***Si*** - Preference to <u>trap/reserve</u> sensory details for <u>reflection</u>.
- ***Se*** - Preference to <u>engage</u> with sensory details for <u>representable action</u>.
- ***Ni*** - Preference to <u>trap/reserve</u> abstract patterns for <u>reflection</u>.
- ***Ne*** - Preference to <u>engage</u> with abstract patterns for <u>representable action</u>.
- ***Fi*** - Preference to <u>trap/reserve</u> emotions (any) for <u>reflection</u>.
- ***Fe*** - Preference to <u>engage</u> with emotions (any) for <u>representable action</u>.
- ***Ti*** - Preference to <u>trap/reserve</u> mechanical logic for <u>reflection</u>.
- ***Te*** - Preference to <u>engage</u> with mechanical logic for <u>representable action</u>.



## 4. Note Before Proceeding


### 4.1 <u>About The Method</u>:

- This method tries to type an individual in terms of ***"Jungian typology"*** for its simplicity & consistency.
- Then the result it piped to its equivalent MBTI type.
- Then at last, a refutation for the result is presented.
- If refutation seems **"too much"** deviated, then competing tokens are reconsidered.
- Unlike rest of the methods where behavior is noticed & then functions are typed, this one types first & refutes later.



### 4.2 <u>Common Pitfalls/Confusions</u>:

- For linear processing, extroverted function after introverted (I-E) means actions are taken only after reflection.
- Meaning, for an INTJ (Ni-Te), first abstract patterns are internally processed/ reflected (Ni), then they are projected as real-world practical systems (Te), verbally or in practice.
- While for introverted function after extroverted (E-I) means actions are hammered with most obvious way (E) in order to gain insights (I).
- For example, an ENTJ (Te-Ni) takes most objective or conventional approach in real-world systems (Te), and gains insights from the results to later reflect on them (Ni).
- Then similarly the repeatition occurs when moving towards tertiary & auxiliary function (I-E-I-E or E-I-E-I) - think sinusoidal wave graph.



## 5. Procedure (v6.1.3)


1. Carefully read & get a feel of each Jungian function, and its two derivative cognitive functions from **secction 1** to **4**.
2. List down all the traits of the person/ character/ entity you want to type.
3. For each of the trait, write comma seperated Jungian functions (**N**, **S**, **T**, **F**) with a rating on range of **\[-3,3\]** (each of the 4).
4. Mark each irrelevant trait with **X** (independent trait).
5. Sum up all the points for each function & write it in **chained score** format as $f1:f2:f3:f4$ where each $f$ is a Jungian function.
6. Rule is that functions with same scores can be interchanged, and some functions can be scored negatively when a trait shows its absence.
7. If their ordering doesn't make sense in MBTI terms, re-evaluate if required (write $N:T:F:S$ instead of $T:N:F:S$).
8. Now check if the dominant function is turned inward/ processed internally (**I**) or turned outward/ representable externally (**E**).
9. Now as per that, type the Jungian personality for the subject (MBTI to Jungian example: ***INTJ = IN(T)***).
10. Then pipe the **equivalent MBTI type** for the previously found **Jungian type**. If procedure is followed properly, the cognitive functions are expected to be explainable with their ordering.

> **<u>TIPS</u>:**
> - Explain why each choosen score & function for their corresponding traits make sense.
> - Also explain why the independent traits don't fit/ pervade the cognitive theory.
> - Best it is advised to refute for the functions which are **not** part of the stack too.

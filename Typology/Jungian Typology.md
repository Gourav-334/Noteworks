## 2. Jungian Definitions


### 2.1 <u>Information</u>:

- **<u>Sensing (S)</u>:** Experiencing a system in terms of ***physical stimulus***.
- **<u>Intuiting (N)</u>:** Experiencing a system in terms of ***unconscious visions***.
- **<u>Feeling (F)</u>:** Evaluating contents of a system in terms of ***abstract values***.
- **<u>Thinking (T)</u>:** Evaluating contents of a system in terms of ***logical relations***.


### 2.2 <u>Energy Direction</u>:

- **<u>Introversion (I)</u>:** Considering ***subjective*** data for evaluation.
- **<u>Extroversion (E)</u>:** Adapting to ***objective*** external systems.


### 2.3 <u>Cognitive Functions Definition</u>:

- ***Si*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>sensation</u> for evaluation.
- ***Se*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>sensation</u> of external system.
- ***Ni*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>visions</u> for evaluation.
- ***Ne*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>visions</u> of external system.
- ***Fi*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>values</u> for evaluation.
- ***Fe*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>values</u> of external system.
- ***Ti*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>logic</u> for evaluation.
- ***Te*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>logic</u> of external system.



## 3. Note Before Proceeding


### 3.1 <u>About The Method</u>:

- This method tries to type an individual in terms of ***"Jungian typology"*** for its simplicity & consistency.
- Then the result it piped to its equivalent MBTI type.


### 3.2 <u>Common Pitfalls/Confusions</u>:

- For linear processing, extroverted function after introverted (**I-E**) means actions are taken only after reflection.
- Meaning, for an **INTJ** (**Ni-Te**), first an unconscious singular image is caught (**Ni**), then they adapt to objective logic for representing their vision (**Te**).
- While for introverted function after extroverted (**E-I**) means actions are hammered with most obvious way (**E**) in order to gain insights (**I**).
- For example, an **ENTJ** (**Te-Ni**) considers objective logic to fulfill needs (**Te**), and then sees the vision that those fulfillments can serve (**Ni**).
- Then similarly the repetition occurs when moving towards tertiary & auxiliary function (**I-E-I-E or E-I-E-I**). Think of how sinusoidal wave graph looks like.
- Verbal expression or actions arising from any function doesn't indicate a function itself. Cognitive functions are processed in mind, where acting or not acting on them is a choice.
- Direction of processing from ***dominant*** to ***inferior*** function is different from which function one uses the most, even though stronger functions might be used more.



## 4. Procedure (v7.1.0)


1. Carefully read & get a feel of each Jungian function, and its two derivative cognitive functions from **section 1** to **4**.
2. List down all the traits of the person/ character/ entity you want to type.
3. For each of the trait, write comma seperated Jungian functions (**N**, **S**, **T**, **F**) with a rating on range of **\[-3,3\]** (each of the 4).
4. Mark each irrelevant trait with **X** (independent trait).
5. Sum up all the points for each function & write it in **chained score** format as $f1:f2:f3:f4$ where each $f$ is a Jungian function.
6. Rule is that functions with same scores can be interchanged, and some functions can be scored negatively when a trait shows its absence.
7. If their ordering doesn't make sense in MBTI terms, re-evaluate if required (write $N:T:F:S$ instead of $T:N:F:S$).
8. Now check if the dominant function is turned inward/ processed internally (**I**) or turned outward/ representable externally (**E**).
9. Now as per that, type the Jungian personality for the subject (MBTI to Jungian example: ***INTJ = IN(T)***).
10. Then pipe the **equivalent MBTI type** for the previously found **Jungian type**. If procedure is followed properly, the cognitive functions are expected to be explainable with their ordering.



## 5. Last Change Log


### 5.3 <u>What's New</u>:

- Clearer and more accurate definition written for direction of focus (**I** or **E**).
- Cognitive functions definitions written with clear understanding of difference of perceiving and judging.
- Functions are written as per Jung's definitions, but with logical consistencies of his cryptic lines.


### 5.2 <u>Unsolved Mysteries</u>:

- How to identify feeling function in psychopaths, sociopaths or desensitized individuals?
- What happens with the last 4 (shadow) function stack?

## 2. Jungian Definitions


### 2.1 <u>Information</u>:

- **<u>Sensing (S)</u>:** Experiencing a system in terms of ***physical stimulus***.
- **<u>Intuiting (N)</u>:** Experiencing a system in terms of ***unconscious visions***.
- **<u>Feeling (F)</u>:** Evaluating contents of a system in terms of ***abstract values***.
- **<u>Thinking (T)</u>:** Evaluating contents of a system in terms of ***logical relations***.


### 2.2 <u>Energy Direction</u>:

- **<u>Introversion (I)</u>:** Considering ***subjective*** data for evaluation.
- **<u>Extroversion (E)</u>:** Adapting to ***objective*** external systems.


### 2.3 <u>Cognitive Functions Definition</u>:

- ***Si*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>sensation</u> for evaluation.
- ***Se*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>sensation</u> of external system.
- ***Ni*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>visions</u> for evaluation.
- ***Ne*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>visions</u> of external system.
- ***Fi*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>values</u> for evaluation.
- ***Fe*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>values</u> of external system.
- ***Ti*** - Considering <u>subjective</u> <u>logic</u> for evaluation.
- ***Te*** - Adapting to <u>objective</u> <u>logic</u> of external system.



## 3. Note Before Proceeding


### 3.1 <u>About The Method</u>:

- This method tries to type an individual in terms of ***"Jungian typology"*** for its simplicity & consistency.
- Then the result it piped to its equivalent MBTI type.


### 3.2 <u>Common Pitfalls/Confusions</u>:

- For linear processing, extroverted function after introverted (**I-E**) means actions are taken only after reflection.
- Meaning, for an **INTJ** (**Ni-Te**), first an unconscious singular image is caught (**Ni**), then they adapt to objective logic for representing their vision (**Te**).
- While for introverted function after extroverted (**E-I**) means actions are hammered with most obvious way (**E**) in order to gain insights (**I**).
- For example, an **ENTJ** (**Te-Ni**) considers objective logic to fulfill needs (**Te**), and then sees the vision that those fulfillments can serve (**Ni**).
- Then similarly the repetition occurs when moving towards tertiary & auxiliary function (**I-E-I-E or E-I-E-I**). Think of how sinusoidal wave graph looks like.
- Verbal expression or actions arising from any function doesn't indicate a function itself. Cognitive functions are processed in mind, where acting or not acting on them is a choice.
- Direction of processing from ***dominant*** to ***inferior*** function is different from which function one uses the most, even though stronger functions might be used more.



## 4. Procedure (v7.0.0)


1. Carefully read & get a feel of each Jungian function, and its two derivative cognitive functions from **section 1** to **4**.
2. List down all the traits of the person/ character/ entity you want to type.
3. Now try grouping these traits as per mutual relevancy to each other.
4. Then for each group, order the traits in the order of their way of processing.
5. Assign a **Jungian** function for each trait in each group, then type the group.
6. If any trait seems confusing, leave it as it is. Else look at their direction (**I**/**E**) & rewrite them.
7. Resolve the confusing traits in form of **Jungian functions** into **cognitive functions** now.
8. Check for consistency in the answers for each group, and provide point to each type formed.
9. The type with most points is chosen to be proven.



## 5. Last Change Log


### 5.3 <u>What's New</u>:

- Clearer and more accurate definition written for direction of focus (**I** or **E**).
- Cognitive functions definitions written with clear understanding of difference of perceiving and judging.
- Functions are written as per Jung's definitions, but with logical consistencies of his cryptic lines.


### 5.2 <u>Unsolved Mysteries</u>:

- How to identify feeling function in psychopaths, sociopaths or desensitized individuals?
- What happens with the last 4 (shadow) function stack?

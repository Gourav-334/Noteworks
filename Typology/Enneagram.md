# $\fbox{ENNEAGRAM}$



## 1. Definitions


### 1.1 <u>Type-Related</u>:

- **Triad:** The grouping of three types based on a shared "center" of intelligence - Gut (Instinct/Doing), Heart (Emotion/Feeling), and Head (Logic/Thinking). Each triad shares a fundamental way of misinterpreting reality.
- **Gut triad (8,9,1):** This triad is concerned with existence and territory. It is the "Doing" center. The core issue here is a distortion of the "Will" and a struggle with the external environment.
- **Heart triad (2,3,4):** This triad is concerned with identity and image. It is the "Feeling" center. The core issue here is the "Ego-Image"—how the person is perceived and how they perceive themselves.
- **Head triad (5,6,7):** This triad is concerned with security and orientation. It is the "Thinking" center. The core issue here is **Fear** and the lack of "Inner Guidance."
- **Fixation (The Cognitive Bug):** This is the "mental preoccupation" of the ego. It is a recurring thought pattern or a "filter" through which you view the world.
- **Passion (The Energy Leak):** This is the "emotional motor" that drives the fixation. It is a distorted way of feeling that fuels the ego’s survival strategy.
- **Trap (The Logical Loop):** This is the false solution the ego offers to fix its problems. It is a "trap" because the more you do it, the more you reinforce the fixation.
- **Holy Idea (The Source Code):** The "enlightened" perspective that occurs when the fixation is dropped. It is the objective truth that the ego-fixation was trying to simulate or replace.


### 1.2 <u>Subtype-Related</u>:

- **Self-preservation (SP):** Conservation of the Organism. Focuses on food, health, and "nesting."
- **Social (SO):** Conservation of the Group. Focuses on the "Totem"—your place in the hierarchy or specialized knowledge.
- **Sexual (SX):** Conservation of the Species. Focuses on the "Relation"—the intense, one-on-one "merging" with a partner or an obsession.

| **1** |     Gut     | **Resentment –** Comes from feeling an obligation to do the right thing while others seem to get away with shirking that responsibility.  | **Anger –** Is an energy that arises in service of correcting things that don't match an internalized sense of rightness. It can be noticed in the form of criticism of things not being done correctly.                                            | **Perfection –** Criticizing everything for not being perfect, leading to perpetual criticism.                                                                                                   | **Holy Perfection –** The awareness that Reality is a process, moving with direction and purpose. Within this movement each moment is connected by the process with the one goal, and thus is perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **2** |    Heart    | **Flattery –** Represents the tendency to pay compliments or special attention to others in order to manipulate oneself into their favor. | **Pride –** Is a self-inflated feeling of importance in the lives of others, coming from a feeling of being needed or indispensable in some way. Often it arises out of the belief that I have no needs but am able to satisfy the needs of others. | **Freedom –** Dependence on attention, creating a cycle of seeking freedom through flattery and approval, but never achieving true independence.                                                 | **Holy Will, Holy Freedom –** The awareness that Reality, moving with direction and according to fixed natural laws, flows with a certain force. The easiest way to deal with this force is to move with it. This is true freedom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **3** |    Heart    | **Vanity –** Places great emphasis on one's appearance, qualities, abilities, achievements, etc. in order to feel validated.              | **Deceit –** Is a packaging of oneself in order to successfully sell oneself to others. The authentic self aside from the packaging is often lost in the image produced by the presentation.                                                        | **Efficiency –** Excessive efficiency covering up problems, leading to overwork and deception.                                                                                                   | **Holy Harmony, Holy Law, Holy Hope –** The awareness that there are no exceptions to the natural laws which govern the Cosmos, and that these laws are completely objective, operating as an inter-connected unity. The highest law is the totality of Reality itself. Certitude in the objectivity and total applicability of those laws is true hope.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **4** |    Heart    | **Melancholy –** Surrounds a lack of emotional fulfillment that longs for what isn't and disparages what is.                              | **Envy –** Notices how others have what I don't because others are more capable than I am. It's a comparison of the positive in others with the negative in the self.                                                                               | **Authenticity –** Perpetual questioning of reasons and whys, leading to endless inquiry without resolution.                                                                                     | **Holy Origin –** The awareness that all individuals are born as the result of natural, objective laws; that these laws continue to operate within them throughout their lives. Because all the laws are interconnected, each individual always has an intimate physical connection with the Totality of Reality—the Cosmos. From this springs true originality.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **5** |    Head     | **Stinginess –** Hoards resources and minimizes needs in an attempt to compensate for a world that seems to take more than it gives.      | **Avarice –** Is a greed not for wealth but for time and space to process the world through the intellect. It's a response to a world that can seem at times intrusive, chaotic, and overwhelming.                                                  | **Observer –** Hiding and watching life from sidelines without participating.                                                                                                                    | **Holy Omniscience, Holy Transparency –** The awareness that because every individual is intimately connected with the entire cosmos by the operation of objective laws within their own bodies, there is no separateness or alienation except as a mental hallucination. Because the cosmic laws govern every aspect of ourselves, there is no possibility of hiding from the Cosmos, or avoiding the results of natural processes. When we understand this, we are completely at peace with our past.                                                   |
| **6** |    Head     | **Cowardice –** Is the tendency to succumb to or challenge fears or doubts that arise from an uncertain mind.                             | **Fear –** Is often a generalized mistrust of what and how others are thinking. This may be allayed by a questioning in search of certainty or an action that confronts the perceived fear.                                                         | **Security –** Seeking safety but continuing to adventure beyond it.                                                                                                                             | **Holy Strength, Holy Faith –** The awareness that the Cosmos is a self-regulating mechanism, existing in a state of balance, and as long as the objective laws which govern this balance are respected, an individual can exist in a state of harmony with Reality, moving toward his own personal fulfillment. Faith is a Holy Idea, not a belief. It is the certitude that each of us has an Essence and that this Essence coming from God, belongs to God.                                                                                            |
| **7** |    Head     | **Planning –** Lives in future anticipation of more enjoyable alternatives to boring, uncomfortable, painful, or limiting situations.     | **Gluttony –** Of the mind is a desire to taste life in all its offerings. The mind imagines an endless stream of appealing possibilities with the challenge of how to experience them all with limited time.                                       | **Idealism –** Grand, unrealistic plans that fail repeatedly.                                                                                                                                    | **Holy Wisdom, Holy Work, Holy Plan –** The awareness that Reality exists as a succession of moments, each experienced as ‘the present,’ and that it is only by existing in the present that the constant unfolding of the Cosmos can be experienced. Only by working in the present can real work be done and real results achieved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **8** |     Gut     | **Vengeance –** Experiences the world as taking advantage of the vulnerable and a reminder to stand strong and assertive against it.      | **Lust –** Is one of pursuing intensity or honesty of experience that feels more real and energizing. For others this intensity is often felt as too much, requiring the type 8 to sit on the energy so as not to overwhelm others.                 | **Justice –** Searching for justice through rebellion and revenge, leading to excess and destruction.                                                                                            | **Holy Truth –** The awareness that the cosmos objectively exists now; that this existence is its own definition, and continues whether an individual understands it or not; and that the individual experiences the truth of Reality most completely when he views each moment fresh, without preconceptions about what should be happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **9** |     Gut     | **Indolence –** Arises from the negation or forgetfulness of one's own agenda in order to go along with the agenda of others.             | **Sloth –** Is an inertia seeking and maintaining comfort, averse to conflict and disruption. It's losing oneself in routines or activities that allow one to just be without having any goals to strive for or expectations to meet.               | **Seeker –** Looking outside for comfort and being, not inside; the indolent type goes looking for the love and meaning he feels deprived of; he becomes a continual seeker, but never a finder. | **Holy Love –** The awareness that though the laws which govern reality are objective, they are not cold, because these cosmic laws inevitably lead to the creation of organic life, and Life itself, like all natural phenomena, fulfills a cosmic purpose. As soon as the mind’s word mechanism is destroyed, love, the natural condition of the mind, appears. Love begins the moment man contemplates the Creation and says “Thank you, God.” All men feel this somewhat, no animal can feel this at all. Man alone can know that all comes from God. |

| **1** | _Self-Preservation Ones_ focus on making everything they do more perfect. They are the true perfectionists of the Enneagram. They see themselves as highly flawed and try to improve themselves and make every detail of what they do right. These people are the most anxious and worried Ones, but also the most friendly and warm.                                                                                                                                                     | _Social Ones_ focus on doing things perfectly in a larger sense—knowing the right way to do things—and modeling how to do things right for others. An intellectual type, these Ones have a teacher mentality; they see their role as helping others see what they already know–how to be perfect.                                                                                                                  | _One-to-One Ones_ focus on making other people—and society as a whole—more perfect. More reformers than perfectionists, they tend to display more anger and zeal than the other Ones. These Ones focus less attention on perfecting their own behavior and pay more attention to whether or not others are doing things right.          |
| **2** | _Self-Preservation Twos_ seek to gain approval through being charming and youthful. Less oriented to giving and more burdened by helping, they charm others into liking them as an unconscious effort to get people to take care of them.

| **3** | _Self-Preservation Threes_ work hard to assure material security for themselves and the people around them. Oriented to being good (as well as looking good) according to social consensus, they want to appear successful, but they don’t want to brag or self-promote in an obvious way (because that wouldn’t be good). SP Threes are self-sufficient, extremely hard-working, results-oriented, and modest.                                                                           | _Social Threes_ work hard to look flawless in the eyes of others.

| **4** | _Self-Preservation Fours_ are stoic,  strong, and long-suffering—emotionally sensitive on the inside, they often don’t communicate their darker feelings to others. While they feel things deeply, and may feel sad inside, they often have a sunny, upbeat exterior, as they often received the message early on that their caretakers couldn’t handle their pain or darker emotions.

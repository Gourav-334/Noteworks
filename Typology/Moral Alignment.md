# $\fbox{MORAL ALIGNMENT}$



## 1. Definitions


### 1.1 <u>Axis</u>:

- **<u>Impulse</u>:** Personal tendency towards a category of act.
- **<u>Structure</u>:** Type of response/action to **tendency**.


### 1.2 <u>Impulses</u>:

- **<u>Good</u>:** Tendency to filter decisions based on inner believed ***good*** values.
- **<u>Evil</u>:** Tendency to filter decisions based on personally believed ***evil*** values.
- **<u>Neutral</u>:** ***Not*** having any feeling of good or evil, putting ***survival & situation diffusion*** above.


### 1.3 <u>Structure</u>:

- **<u>Lawful</u>:** Tendency for ***sticking to rules/laws*** of a system in response to **impulse**.
- **<u>Chaotic</u>:** Tendency to deliberately ***break rules/laws*** of a system in response to **impulse**.
- **<u>Neutral</u>:** ***Not*** having any feeling towards or against laws/rules, thus responding to **impulse** with most efficient option.



## 2. Facts & Myth Busters


- Understanding of objective truth and reality doesn't make someone naturally **neutral**, but inner tendency does.
- Both the axis are result of ***inner tendency*** or ***feeling***, not visible actions.
- Clashes among one or both same axis are expected for perceived difference in values.
- Being aligned with **neutrality** on any or both axis doesn't equate to stable behavior.
- While everyone has some of the each tendency, one dominates and controls the individual.
- By doing something that doesn't align with inner tendency on any axis, it produces a feeling of unease in any form.
- **Evil** impulse doesn't only mean making effort to cause trouble for others, but could also be to pursue or respond to something unnecessary, costing others negatively, over survival (**neutral**).
- Taking hard decisions can pervade the basis of moral alignment.

## 4. Procedure (v1.0.0)

1. Understand about the axis and terms from ****section 1*** and ***2***.
2. From the ***section 1.2***, rate yourself for each **impulse** on a scale of $[1,5]$.
3. From the ***section 1.3***, rate yourself for each **structure** on a scale of $[1,5]$.
4. Multiply the results from **step 1 & 2** to make the $3 \times 3$ grid.
5. Choose the combination with highest score.
6. Confirm the result by reading same combination from ***section 3.2***.

>**<u>NOTE</u>:**
>One can check the strength of alignment by seeing what percentage each combination makes up among all.

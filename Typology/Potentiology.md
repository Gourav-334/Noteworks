# $\fbox{POTENTIOLOGY}$



## 1. Introduction

Potentiology is a cognitive framework that describes **how a subject perceives, evaluates, and stabilizes reality** through distinct modes of perception, referred to as cognitive functions. Rather than focusing on behavior, traits, or personality descriptions, the theory models cognition as a **dynamic system of perceptual domains and energy capacities**.

The framework is built on two foundational distinctions. First, perception operates across four domains: **Experience (X), Abstraction (A), Logic (L), and Morality (M)**. Second, each domain can be oriented **subjectively**, referencing internal impressions, or **objectively**, referencing properties of the external object. The combination of domain and direction produces eight cognitive functions.

Unlike static typology systems, Potentiology introduces an **energy-based positioning model**, where each function has a finite capacity and depletes with use. The ego defaults to the function with the highest available energy at a given moment, while conscious choice may override this tendency at a cost. This allows the theory to account for burnout, dissatisfaction, stress behavior, and functional shifts over time without invoking pathology.

Potentiology is not a diagnostic or predictive tool. It does not claim to measure intelligence, morality, or mental health. Its purpose is explanatory: to provide a **structural language** for discussing perceptual bias, evaluative conflict, and environmental fit.

The theory draws conceptual inspiration from Jungian psychology and related typological systems but is **not derived from them**. All definitions, mechanisms, and type structures in Potentiology are internally defined and operate according to their own logic.

This document presents the core terminology, functional domains, directional mechanics, energy model, and resulting cognitive types, followed by guidance on responsible use and interpretation.



## 2. Terminologies

- **Function:** Shorter term for *cognitive function*.
- **Cognitive function:** Mode of perception with a direction of focus.
- **Subject:** Conscious entity which perceives the *object*.
- **Object:** Content of consciousness which is being perceived by *subject*.
- **Ego:** Center of consciousness which *selects*, *integrates*, *organizes*, and *identifies* experiences for the subject.
- **Suppressed:** Consciously holding back something.
- **Repressed:** Unconsciously blocked from awareness.
- **Seed:** The point on timeline from where a function starts fresh after previous crash.
- **Crash:** A temporary shutdown of a function caused by sustained conflict with its opposing function domain, leading to loss of evaluative authority by primary function.
- **Impression:** A compressed, internally stored representation of repeated perceptions within a domain.
- **Leakage:** Conscious or unconscious use of a cognitive function that belongs to negative realm, with cost of high mental energy consumption.



## 3. Function Domains


### 3.1 <u>Experiencer (X)</u>:

#### 3.1.1 Definition:
*"**Experience** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object **concretely**, as an **experience**."*

![X](./media/x.png)

#### 3.1.2 Description:
Experience is **concrete** perception, where the object is perceived as it is in **concrete form**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will take the perception as a **matter of fact**. It won't seek to notice any pattern, logic, or value in it. For example, a subject perceives a printer printing pages using an experiencer function. It will say, *"Okay, so printer prints pages. It could be used in printing pages as per requirement."* It doesn't seek to understand what problem a printer could solve, how it works mechanically, or what moral values it might hold. For an experiencer, its just the input and output he experienced.


### 3.2 <u>Abstraction (A)</u>:

#### 3.2.1 Definition:
*"**Abstraction** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **latent patterns**."*

![A](./media/a.png)

#### 3.2.2 Description:
Abstraction is **pattern** based perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **latent patterns**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will understand the **existing** or **potential patterns** related to it. Taking same example as previous, a subject perceives a printer printing pages using an abstraction function. It will say, *"There are millions of newspapers printed each day, so news publishers must be spending a lot on their maintenance. That could be why their budgets are so high."* It doesn't see the object or focus of consciousness as something concrete, but something explaining or creating patterns.


### 3.3 <u>Logic (L)</u>:

#### 3.3.1 Definition:
*"**Logic** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **logical properties**."*

![L](./media/l.png)

#### 3.3.2 Description:
Logic is **mechanical** perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **logical properties**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will see that in form of **logical connections**. Taking the same printer example, if the subject perceives a printer printing pages using a logic function. It will say, *"Printer prints pages? How is that? What's going on within it? What kind of components is it using? How are they inter-connected?"* It sees the object as something with **logical properties**, governing its nature, noticing its logical details first.


### 3.4 <u>Morality (M)</u>:

#### 3.4.1 Definition:
*"**Morality** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **moral values**."*

![M](./media/m.png)

#### 3.4.2 Description:
Morality is **value-based** perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **moral values**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will see that in form of **moral values**. Consider the same printer example from previous examples, if the subject perceives a printer printing pages using a moral function. It will say, *"Such an incredible innovative piece made by someone is what we together are taking leverage of. We should similarly strive to contribute to society, as its a good virtue."* It sees the object as something that **holds some value** in it, or displays moral values in some way.



## 4. Directions For Functions


### 4.1 <u>Subjective (Sbj)</u>:

#### 4.1.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective functions**, the subject evaluates the object with reference to the **available impressions** of target function domain with the **subject**. This perception is then merged into existing impressions as a single unit, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![Sbj](./media/sbj.png)

#### 4.1.2 Description:
Subject uses subjective function to understand the object by **recalling** their **past perceptions**. These perceptions exist in a **singular form** as an impression. And this new perceptions finally merges into a **single impression** after being understood, expanding understanding with the particular function. This continues with many perceptions and the subject keeps **accumulating new data**, increasing the overall size of unit impression. The subject could later reflect upon this impression **without** having to depend on an active stimulus from object. And because the subject matches object to each content present in impression, it is usually processes **slower** than objective functions.


### 4.2 <u>Objective (Obj)</u>:

#### 4.2.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective functions**, the subject evaluates the object with reference to the **available details** of target function domain about the **object**. This perception **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those details, thus **dependent** on object."*

![Obj](./media/obj.png)

#### 4.2.2 Description:
Subject uses objective functions to understand the object by **noticing the details** that object possesses. These perceptions are seen as something **fresh and new**, not necessarily to do with past perceptions. It is **not** stored as a unit impression, instead it is just adaptation to the object's details **temporarily**, until the subject receives **active stimulus** from the object. After this stimulus ends, there is no use of it. Its not that the subject may not value what he learned from objective details, but he **won't reflect** upon it if he perceives newer objects. And because the subject isolates object as a system, it usually processes **faster** than subjective functions.



## 5. Cognitive Functions


### 5.1 <u>Subjective Experiencer (SbjX)</u>:

#### 5.1.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective experiencer** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **concrete impressions** with the **subject**. This experience is then merged into existing impressions about experiences as a single experience, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjX](./media/sbjx.png)

#### 5.1.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjX** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that experience makes sense to his existing impression of experiences. It accepts the experience if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the experience if it seems different from their experience. But they might still acquire newer experiences through **ObjX** leakages. Example for **SbjX** usage would be, a person understands why one of the two newly brought printers works as the previous one used to be, but won't prefer a printer with different controls. Or even after witnessing its working, he would prefer using the printer with known controls. But he will accept it if there is no other choice, or an **ObjX** leakage occurs.


### 5.2 <u>Objective Experiencer (ObjX)</u>:

#### 5.2.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective experiencer** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **concrete details** about the **object**. This experience **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those experiences, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjX](./media/objx.png)

#### 5.2.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjX** function, it perceives the object and notices the concrete details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those experiences. It is open to adapting newer experiences when required even if they don't align with personal experiences. But they might still form impressions through **SbjX** leakages. Example for **ObjX** usage would be, a person sees the difference in two newly brought printers with differing controls. He will be drawn towards using the printer with different controls than the existing one if it is situationally better to use. But he will use the printer with known working if there is none other available, or a **SbjX** leakage occurs.


### 5.3 <u>Subjective Abstraction (SbjA)</u>:

#### 5.3.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective abstraction** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **abstract impressions** with the **subject**. This abstract is then merged into existing impressions about patterns as a single abstract, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjA](./media/sbja.png)

#### 5.3.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjA** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that abstraction makes sense to his existing impression of abstracts. It accepts the abstract if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the experience if it seems different from their abstraction. But they might still acquire newer abstractions through **ObjA** leakages. Example for **SbjA** usage would be, a person sees a new printer. He already possesses abstract model for previous printers, with different controls. He will look at its controls, and figures out how they must work by referring to those abstractions. And if it doesn't work, he either interprets the printer as something else, or looks for other abstract patterns under pressure, or due to **ObjA** leakage.


### 5.4 <u>Objective Abstraction (ObjA)</u>:

#### 5.4.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective abstraction** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **abstract details** about the **object**. This abstraction **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those patterns, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjA](./media/obja.png)

#### 5.4.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjA** function, it perceives the object and notices the abstract details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those patterns. It is open to adapting newer abstractions when required even if they don't align with personal abstract understanding. But they might still form impressions through **SbjA** leakages. Example for **ObjA** usage would be, a person sees a new printer. He looks for the abstract details present in the printer itself, and understands the pattern its controls form altogether. Then he will try running it as per the pattern he figured out in its controls. If it doesn't work, he will look for a different pattern in it instead of interpreting it as something else. But he will use past impressions if not able to figure out for too long, or through **SbjA** leakage.


### 5.5 <u>Subjective Logician (SbjL)</u>:

#### 5.5.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective logician** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **logical impressions** with the **subject**. This logic is then merged into existing impressions as a single logic, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjL](./media/sbjl.png)

#### 5.5.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjL** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that logic makes sense to his existing impression of logic. It accepts the logical property if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the logic if it seems different from their logic. But they might still acquire newer logic through **ObjL** leakages. Example for **SbjL** usage would be, a person sees a new printer in office, and to make sense of its working he checks how it works within. But will reject it if that doesn't match his understanding of logic, or can't figure out its working through existing logical understanding. He might still adapt to work with printer's own logic if there is no other choice, or an **ObjA** leakage occurs.


### 5.6 <u>Objective Logician (ObjL)</u>:

#### 5.6.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective logician** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **logical details** about the **object**. This logic **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those logical properties, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjL](./media/objl.png)

#### 5.6.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjL** function, it perceives the object and notices the logical details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those logic. It is open to adapting newer logic when required even if they don't align with personal logical understanding. But they might still form impressions through **SbjL** leakages. Example for **ObjL** usage would be, a person sees a new printer. He looks for the logical properties present in the printer itself to make sense of how they work. If it doesn't work, they might then try figuring it out as per how they must work using their personal understanding of logical properties through **SbjL** logic.


### 5.7 <u>Subjective Moral (SbjM)</u>:

#### 5.7.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective moral** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **moral impressions** with the **subject**. This value is then merged into existing impressions about morality as a single unit, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjM](./media/sbjm.png)

#### 5.7.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjM** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that value makes sense to his existing impression of morality. It accepts the value if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the value if it seems different from their morals. But they might still acquire newer values through **ObjM** leakages. Example for **SbjM** usage would be, a person is considering buying a new printer. And the company which manufactured it is known for certain tactics to market their products. Now he will not buy it if his past moral impressions take those tactics as immoral. But he might buy if an important work has to be done and there is no other choice, or an **ObjM** leakage occurs with no one else using it in same office has any problem.


### 5.8 <u>Objective Moral (ObjM)</u>:

#### 5.8.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective moral** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **moral details** about the **object**. This morality **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those morals, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjM](./media/objm.png)

#### 5.8.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjM** function, it perceives the object and notices the moral details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those values. It is open to adapting newer values when required even if they don't align with personal morals. But they might still form impressions through **SbjM** leakages. Example for **ObjM** usage would be, a person considers buying new printer. And the company uses questionable marketing tactics like previous example. Now he will check if everyone else in the office who would be using it has any problem with that. If no, he will proceed to buy it and adapt to group's morals. But he might reject it if other users have problem with it, or a **SbjM** leakage occurs.



## 6. Positioning System


### 6.1 <u>Energy Theory</u>:

![Capacity](./media/energy.png)

There are **8 cognitive functions** as discussed before, which are arranged in **decreasing order** of their energy capacity. Meaning, the first function in order (**1st** function) has the highest energy storage capacity, second in series (**2nd function**) has the second highest energy capacity, and so on. And finally the last function in series (**8th function**) has least capacity for storing energy. And the ego tends to default to the function which at a given frame of time has highest energy in them, but after switching a fixed energy cost is paid by the chosen function, or energy in it is less than that cost, it outright crashes to point where no energy is left.

So that way, when all the functions have theoretically full energy as per their respective capacities, the ego defaults to **1st function**. And when the energy level for **1st function** drops below **2nd function** with minimal energy cost paid, the ego will default to using **2nd function** as perceiving function. And when energy level of **2nd function** falls below the third's level with minimal cost paid, ego switches to using **3rd function** for perceiving. Or if **1st function** charges to a level more than **3rd function**, ego returns to using **1st function**.

Cognitive functions **deplete** energy during use but recover only when **disengaged**. Recovery is not automatic and occurs under conditions specific to each function’s domain. In general, recovery is slower than depletion, introducing asymmetry that allows burnout, cascade, and delayed stabilization. The model therefore avoids equilibrium assumptions while preserving long-term functional reuse.

What ego chooses by default, and what the subject manually chooses to use **aren't same**. Ego works as per the defined **energy theory**, but the subject might choose a function with lower energy level and at any position, **by choice**. Ego just **directs the tendency** of subject towards the function with highest energy, **not** control the subject's decision which they can consciously take **against tendency**. But its usually **unhealthy** when subject chooses so, resulting in frequent burnout and dissatisfaction. The tendency of ego towards a particular mode of perception if used at right area of focus, it adds to satisfaction of the subject.


### 6.2 <u>Positioning Logic</u>:

If first function is **Sbj** type, all other odd positions (**3rd**, **5th**, **7th**) are also of **Sbj** type, and the even positions (**2nd**, **4th**, **6th**, **8th**) are of **Obj** type. Else if first function is **Obj** type, all other odd positions (**3rd**, **5th**, **7th**) are also of **Obj** type, and the even positions (**2nd**, **4th**, **6th**, **8th**) are of **Sbj** type.

**Experience (X)** & **Abstraction (A)** in same direction (both **Sbj**/**Obj**) are completely opposite to each other, just like **Logic (L)** & **Morality (M)** in same direction are. This is because **X** & **A**, and **L** & **M** in same direction are two alternative choice subject gets to perceive, where only one can be used. So for example **ObjA**, its complete opposite function would be **ObjX**. Because theoretically when each function is at equal level, the ego will choose the one which has highest energy capacity.

The capacitive position of complete opposite type depends on how far they are from center of positioning. Both the functions must have equal radius from center. So if a function say **ObjM** is at **1st**, **ObjL** would be at **8th**. Or if **ObjM** is at **2nd**, **ObjL** would be at **7th**, and so on.


### 6.3 <u>Types Table</u>:

- The table below shows each 16 type with their most capacitive function (**1st function**) to least capacitive function (**8th function**).

## 7. Types Explanations


### 7.1 <u>SbjXL</u>:

#### 7.1.1 Working

##### **Introduction**
**SbjXL** is a type whose **most capacitive (1st) function** is **Subjective Experiencer (SbjX)**, with **Logic (L)** as the dominant evaluative axis rather than Morality.

##### **Core perceptual orientation**
- The ego defaults to **SbjX**, meaning the subject primarily perceives the world through **internally stored concrete impressions**.
- Experiences are evaluated by **matching new stimuli against past lived experiences**, not by adapting to object details.
- The subject trusts _what has worked before_ as the baseline for reality.

##### **Logical framing (XL)**
- Logic acts as the **structuring lens**, but it is **not primary in perception**.
- Logical evaluation occurs **after experience is accepted into impression space**.
- Logic is used to **stabilize, justify, and preserve experiential consistency**, not to redefine experience proactively.

##### **Functional flow (high $\rightarrow$ low energy)**
1. **SbjX (Primary):** Stable experiential impressions; resistance to unfamiliar experiential formats.
2. **ObjL (Secondary):** Uses external logical rules when necessary, especially for efficiency, compliance, or system interaction.
3. **SbjM (Tertiary):** Moral impressions form gradually from lived experience rather than ideology.
4. **ObjA (Quaternary):** Limited tolerance for abstract speculation unless it directly solves a concrete problem.
5. **Lower functions (ObjX, SbjL, ObjM, SbjA):** Accessed mainly via leakage or under sustained pressure.

##### **Stress and failure pattern**
- Sustained conflict between **SbjX** and **ObjX** (forced unfamiliar experiences) leads to **experiential crash**.
- Under stress, the subject may:
    - Over‑rely on rigid routines
    - Reject objectively superior tools due to unfamiliar experiential formats
    - Display irritation toward abstract or speculative discussions
- Recovery requires **re‑stabilization of familiar experiential patterns**, not persuasion or reasoning.

##### **Satisfaction condition**
- Satisfaction arises when the subject can:
	- Operate in familiar, proven experiential environments
	- Apply logic _instrumentally_ without redefining experience 
	- Avoid repeated forced adaptation to unfamiliar experiential systems

#### 7.1.2 Example

##### **Scenario: Introduction of a new system at the workplace**
A subject of type **SbjXL** has been using a particular workflow or machine for years.
- When a new system is introduced:
    - They first compare it against **how previous systems felt and behaved in practice**, not how it is logically superior.
    - If the experiential interface aligns with stored impressions, adoption is smooth.
    - If it differs significantly, resistance appears even if the new system is objectively better.
- Logical arguments such as:
    - _It is faster_
    - _It is more efficient_
    - _It has better architecture_
    are **secondary**, and persuasive only _after_ experiential acceptance.
- If forced to adopt:
    - The subject may comply using **ObjL**, but dissatisfaction accumulates.
    - Repeated forced adaptation may trigger **SbjX crash**, resulting in withdrawal, burnout, or disengagement.

##### **Real‑world behavioral signature**
- Prefers tools, environments, and methods that feel **familiar and proven**.
- Learns best through **hands‑on repetition**, not abstract explanation.
- Values reliability and continuity over innovation for its own sake.

### 7.2 <u>SbjXM</u>:

#### 7.2.1 Working:

##### **Introduction**
**SbjXM** is a type whose **most capacitive (1st) function** is **Subjective Experiencer (SbjX)**, with **Morality (M)** as the dominant evaluative axis rather than Logic.

##### **Core perceptual orientation**
- The ego defaults to **SbjX**, meaning the subject primarily perceives the world through **internally stored concrete impressions**.
- Experiences are evaluated by **matching new stimuli against past lived experiences**, not by adapting to object details.
- What feels familiar, lived, and experientially coherent is treated as trustworthy and real.

##### **Moral framing (XM)**
- Morality acts as the **primary evaluative lens**, but it is **not primary in perception**.
- Moral evaluation occurs **after experience is accepted into impression space**.
- Moral judgments are grounded in **what has been lived and felt as right or wrong**, not in abstract ethical systems or external norms.

##### **Functional flow (high $\rightarrow$ low energy)**
1. **SbjX (Primary):** Stable experiential impressions; preference for familiar experiential formats.
2. **ObjM (Secondary):** Adapts to external moral expectations when necessary, especially for social harmony or situational demands.
3. **SbjL (Tertiary):** Logical impressions form slowly from experience rather than formal reasoning.
4. **ObjA (Quaternary):** Low tolerance for abstract pattern speculation unless it supports experiential or moral coherence.
5. **Lower functions (ObjX, ObjL, SbjM, SbjA):** Accessed mainly via leakage or sustained pressure.

##### **Stress and failure pattern**
- Sustained conflict between **SbjX** and **ObjX** (forced unfamiliar experiences) leads to **experiential crash**.
- Sustained conflict between **SbjM** and **ObjM** (forced moral adaptation) leads to **moral exhaustion**.
- Under stress, the subject may:
	- Withdraw from environments that violate personal experiential values
	- Appear stubborn or emotionally rigid
	- Reject “reasonable” compromises that feel morally wrong based on lived impressions
- Recovery requires **return to familiar experiential environments** and reaffirmation of personal moral impressions.

##### **Satisfaction condition**
- Satisfaction arises when the subject can:
	- Live and operate in environments aligned with personal experiential values
	- Act according to morals derived from lived experience
	- Avoid repeated pressure to morally adapt against internal impressions

#### 7.2.2 Example:

##### **Scenario: Ethical disagreement in a workplace**
A subject of type **SbjXM** works in an organization that introduces a practice considered acceptable by most employees.
- When encountering the practice:
	- The subject evaluates it based on **how similar actions felt in past experiences**, not on formal ethical arguments.
	- If it conflicts with prior lived moral impressions, discomfort arises immediately.
	- Even if the practice is legally permitted or socially accepted, rejection may persist.
- External justifications such as:
	- *Everyone is doing it*
	- *It is standard industry practice*
	- *There is no rule against it*
	are **secondary** and often ineffective unless experiential moral alignment is achieved.
- If forced to comply:
	- The subject may adapt temporarily using **ObjM**.
	- Long-term compliance without alignment leads to dissatisfaction, disengagement, or exit.

##### **Real-world behavioral signature**

### 7.3 <u>ObjLX</u>:

#### 7.3.1 Working:

##### **Introduction**
**ObjLX** is a type whose **most capacitive (1st) function** is **Objective Logician (ObjL)**, with **Experience (X)** as the dominant perceptual counter-domain rather than Abstraction.

##### **Core perceptual orientation**
- The ego defaults to **ObjL**, meaning the subject primarily perceives the world through **objective logical properties present in the object**.
- Objects are evaluated by analyzing how their components, rules, and mechanisms function in reality.
- Truth is determined by **what works according to observable logic**, not by internal impressions or precedent.

##### **Experiential grounding (LX)**
- Experience acts as the **perceptual grounding domain**, but it is **not subjective**.
- The subject seeks to **adapt to concrete realities as they exist**, rather than interpreting them through past impressions.
- Experience is treated as raw input that must conform to logical structure, not as something to be preserved for familiarity.

##### **Functional flow (high $\rightarrow$ low energy)**
1. **ObjL (Primary):** Continuous engagement with external logic, systems, rules, and mechanisms.
2. **SbjX (Secondary):** Forms experiential impressions gradually to support logical stability.
3. **ObjA (Tertiary):** Notices abstract patterns when they improve system efficiency or coherence.
4. **SbjM (Quaternary):** Personal moral impressions are weak and often deferred.
5. **Lower functions (SbjL, ObjX, ObjM, SbjA):** Accessed mainly via leakage or under sustained pressure.

##### **Stress and failure pattern**
- Sustained conflict between **ObjL** and **SbjL** (forced reliance on internal logic without external validation) leads to **logical instability**.
- Sustained conflict between **ObjL** and **ObjM** (forced moral compliance overriding logic) leads to **systemic frustration**.
- Under stress, the subject may:
  - Become rigidly rule-bound or pedantic
  - Dismiss experiential or emotional concerns as irrelevant
  - Over-optimize systems while ignoring human impact
- Recovery requires **re-engagement with objective systems** where logic is respected and effective.

##### **Satisfaction condition**
- Satisfaction arises when the subject can:
  - Operate in environments governed by clear rules and logic
  - Solve concrete problems through system analysis
  - Avoid pressure to prioritize morality or abstraction over functional correctness

#### 7.3.2 Example:

##### **Scenario: Process inefficiency in an organization**

- When examining the workflow:
	- The subject analyzes **how each step logically contributes to the outcome**.
	- Redundant or illogical steps are flagged regardless of tradition or emotional attachment.
	- Past usage or familiarity is considered secondary to logical correctness.
- Arguments such as:
	- *We have always done it this way*
	- *People are comfortable with this method*
	- *Changing it might upset others*
	carry little weight unless they affect system functionality.
- If prevented from implementing changes:
	- The subject may comply temporarily but grows increasingly frustrated.
	- Long-term obstruction can result in disengagement or abrupt exit.

##### **Real-world behavioral signature**
- Naturally spots inefficiencies and contradictions in systems.
- Learns best by **understanding how things work internally**.

**ObjMX** is a type whose **most capacitive (1st) function** is **Objective Moral (ObjM)**, with **Experience (X)** as the dominant perceptual counter-domain rather than Abstraction.

##### **Core perceptual orientation**
- The ego defaults to **ObjM**, meaning the subject primarily perceives the world through **objective moral values present in the environment**.
- Situations are evaluated based on shared norms, social expectations, and externally observable value systems.
- What is considered right or wrong is determined by **collective standards**, not by personal impressions or internal moral narratives.

##### **Experiential grounding (MX)**
- Experience acts as the **perceptual grounding domain**, but it is **objective rather than subjective**.
- The subject adapts to **concrete situational realities** to align with prevailing moral expectations.
- Experience is treated as immediate feedback on whether behavior conforms to or violates accepted norms.

##### **Functional flow (high $\rightarrow$ low energy)**
1. **ObjM (Primary):** Continuous adaptation to external moral values, norms, and social rules.
2. **SbjX (Secondary):** Forms experiential impressions that support moral alignment and situational awareness.

	- Personal logical objections are secondary to collective agreement.
- Arguments such as:
	- *This is how responsible organizations behave*
	- *Most people would find this acceptable*
	- *It maintains trust and reputation*
	carry significant weight.
- If asked to act against group norms:
	- The subject experiences discomfort and hesitation.
	- Prolonged pressure can lead to withdrawal or stress-driven compliance.

##### **Real-world behavioral signature**
- Highly attuned to social expectations and moral climates.

	- Avoid environments that demand constant pragmatic adaptation without explanation



#### 7.5.2 Example:

##### **Scenario: Evaluating a new procedure**
A subject of type **SbjLX** is introduced to a new operational procedure.
- When assessing the procedure:
	- The subject first checks whether it **makes logical sense internally**.

	- Experiential success alone is insufficient without logical clarity.
- Arguments such as:
	- *It works in practice*
	- *Others have tested it*
	- *It saves time*
	are secondary unless the underlying logic is explained.
- If forced to follow the procedure:
	- The subject may comply using **ObjX**, but dissatisfaction accumulates.

### 7.12 <u>ObjAM</u>:


#### 7.12.1 Working:

##### **Introduction**
**ObjAM** is a type whose **most capacitive (1st) function** is **Objective Abstraction (ObjA)**, with **Morality (M)** as the dominant evaluative axis rather than Logic.

##### **Core perceptual orientation**
- The ego defaults to **ObjA**, meaning the subject primarily perceives the world through **abstract patterns, structures, and relationships present in the object**.
- Situations are interpreted by identifying overarching systems, trends, or models that exist independently of personal meaning.
- Reality is understood in terms of **how elements relate within a broader abstract structure**.

##### **Moral framing (AM)**
- Morality acts as the **primary evaluative lens**, shaping which abstract patterns are accepted or rejected.
- Moral evaluation is based on **externally recognized ethical frameworks** rather than personal values.
- Abstract systems are judged according to whether they align with accepted moral ideals or societal principles.

##### **Functional flow (high $\rightarrow$ low energy)**
1. **ObjA (Primary):** Continuous adaptation to external abstract systems, patterns, and structures.
2. **SbjM (Secondary):** Forms internal moral impressions from engagement with abstract moral frameworks.
3. **ObjX (Tertiary):** Engages with concrete reality to test or apply abstract models.
4. **SbjL (Quaternary):** Internal logical structuring is weak and often deferred to external systems.
5. **Lower functions (SbjA, ObjM, SbjX, ObjL):** Accessed mainly via leakage or sustained pressure.

##### **Stress and failure pattern**
- Sustained conflict between **ObjA** and **SbjA** (forced personal reinterpretation of abstractions) leads to **conceptual dissonance**.
- Sustained conflict between **ObjA** and **ObjX** (excessive concrete demands) leads to **cognitive overload**.
- Under stress, the subject may:
	- Over-intellectualize moral issues
	- Prioritize systemic correctness over human impact
	- Struggle to act decisively in emotionally charged situations
	- Recovery requires **re-engagement with coherent abstract systems** that provide moral clarity.

##### **Satisfaction condition**
- Satisfaction arises when the subject can:
	- Work within well-defined abstract frameworks
	- Apply moral standards consistently across systems
	- Avoid environments dominated by ambiguity or unstructured experience

#### 7.12.2 Example:

##### **Scenario: Designing a morally guided system**
A subject of type **ObjAM** is tasked with creating or refining a system that must meet ethical standards.
- When approaching the task:
	- The subject focuses on **structuring the system according to abstract models**.
	- Moral requirements are integrated as constraints within the system design.
	- Personal feelings or anecdotal experiences are minimized.
- Arguments such as:
	- *This feels unfair*
	- *It works in practice*
	- *People are uncomfortable with it*
	are secondary unless they can be expressed within the abstract moral framework.
- If forced into ad-hoc decision-making:
	- The subject becomes stressed or indecisive.
	- Performance improves when clear abstract guidelines are restored.

##### **Real-world behavioral signature**
- Strong aptitude for systems design and policy architecture.
- Learns best through formal models and structured frameworks.
- Values consistency, scalability, and principled design over situational flexibility.

##### **One-line definition**
**ObjAM** stabilizes reality through **objective abstraction**, using morality to evaluate and constrain abstract systems.

### 7.13 SbjAL:


#### 7.13.1 Working:

##### **Introduction**
**SbjAL** is a type whose **most capacitive (1st) function** is **Subjective Abstraction (SbjA)**, with **Logic (L)** as the dominant evaluative axis rather than Morality.

##### **Core perceptual orientation**
- The ego defaults to **SbjA**, meaning the subject primarily perceives reality through **internally formed abstract impressions, models, and symbolic patterns**.
- Situations are interpreted by matching them against internal conceptual frameworks rather than concrete details.
- Reality is understood in terms of **what a situation means, implies, or represents**, not merely what is directly observable.

##### **Logical framing (AL)**
- Logic acts as the **primary evaluative lens**, structuring and refining internal abstractions.
- Logical evaluation occurs **within the internal abstract space**, not through direct engagement with external systems.
- Logic is used to test consistency, coherence, and validity of abstract models rather than to optimize practical execution.

##### **Functional flow (high $\rightarrow$ low energy)**
1. **SbjA (Primary):** Stable internal abstract models, symbolic interpretations, and conceptual narratives.
2. **ObjL (Secondary):** Adapts to external logical systems when they support or validate internal abstractions.
3. **SbjX (Tertiary):** Concrete experiential impressions are selectively absorbed to support abstract understanding.
4. **ObjM (Quaternary):** External moral expectations are weakly tolerated and often subordinated to logical structure.
5. **Lower functions (ObjA, SbjL, ObjX, SbjM):** Accessed mainly via leakage or sustained pressure.

##### **Stress and failure pattern**
- Sustained conflict between **SbjA** and **ObjA** (forced adoption of externally imposed abstractions) leads to **conceptual alienation**.
- Sustained conflict between **SbjA** and **ObjX** (excessive demand for concrete action) leads to **mental fatigue**.
- Under stress, the subject may:
	- Retreat further into internal theorizing
	- Dismiss practical constraints as superficial
	- Over-refine abstract models without implementation
	- Recovery requires **return to internally coherent abstract frameworks** and logical clarification.

##### **Satisfaction condition**
- Satisfaction arises when the subject can:
	- Develop and explore internally meaningful abstract systems
	- Apply logic to refine concepts without external pressure
	- Avoid environments dominated by immediate practicality or moral enforcement

#### 7.13.2 Example:

##### **Scenario: Developing a conceptual framework**
A subject of type **SbjAL** is tasked with developing a theoretical or conceptual model.
- When working on the model:
	- The subject focuses on **structuring internal abstractions logically**.
	- Empirical or practical considerations are secondary to conceptual clarity.
	- External validation is useful but not required for initial confidence.
- Arguments such as:
	- *It works in practice*
	- *People find it useful*
	- *It aligns with ethical values*
	are secondary unless they expose logical inconsistency.
- If forced into immediate application:
	- The subject may comply minimally.
	- Prolonged pressure leads to disengagement or frustration.

##### **Real-world behavioral signature**
- Strong inclination toward theory-building and conceptual synthesis.
- Learns best through abstraction and logical analysis.
- Values elegance, coherence, and internal consistency over immediacy or convention.

##### **One-line definition**
**SbjAL** stabilizes reality through **subjective abstraction**, using logic to structure, validate, and refine internal conceptual models.

- Objects and situations are evaluated by checking their coherence with existing internal logic.
- Truth is defined by **internal logical consistency**, not by immediate practicality or external validation.

##### **Abstract grounding (LA)**
- Abstraction acts as the **grounding perceptual domain**, but it is **subjective rather than objective**.
- Abstract patterns, concepts, and models are interpreted and reshaped through internal logical structures.
- Abstraction serves to expand, refine, and generalize internal logic rather than replace it.

##### **Functional flow (high $\rightarrow$ low energy)**
1. **SbjL (Primary):** Stable internal logical systems and principled reasoning.
2. **ObjA (Secondary):** Adapts to external abstract structures when they align with internal logic.

- Under stress, the subject may:
	- Become rigidly argumentative
	- Dismiss practical or emotional considerations
	- Over-refine logic without applying it
	- Recovery requires **restoration of internal logical coherence** and reduction of external conceptual noise.

##### **Satisfaction condition**
- Satisfaction arises when the subject can:
	- Develop and operate within internally consistent logical systems
	- Engage with abstract ideas on their own analytical terms
	- Avoid environments that demand moral or experiential compromise without logical justification

#### 7.13.2 Example:

##### **Scenario: Evaluating a theoretical model**
A subject of type **SbjLA** encounters a new theoretical or conceptual model.
- When evaluating the model:
	- The subject checks whether it **fits coherently within existing logical frameworks**.
	- Empirical success or popularity is secondary to structural soundness.
	- Abstract elegance matters only if it preserves logical rigor.
- Arguments such as:
	- *It is widely accepted*
	- *It works in practice*
	- *It aligns with values*
	are unconvincing unless logical coherence is demonstrated.
- If pressured to accept the model:
	- The subject may comply superficially.
	- Prolonged pressure leads to disengagement or intellectual withdrawal.

##### **Real-world behavioral signature**
- Strong preference for theoretical clarity and precision.
- Learns best through structured reasoning and proof.

## 8. Important Note


### 8.1 <u>For Mental Health Professionals</u>:

Potentiology is **not a diagnostic or clinical framework** and must not be used as a substitute for established psychological or psychiatric models. It describes **cognitive perception styles and energy dynamics**, not mental health conditions or pathology.

Types, crashes, leakages, and dissatisfaction in Potentiology do **not** indicate disorders. They represent **energy conflicts or misalignment** between a subject’s dominant functions and their environment, which may coexist with but do not imply clinical issues.

For professionals, Potentiology may serve as a **supplementary interpretive tool**, useful for understanding burnout, chronic dissatisfaction, value conflict, or why certain coping strategies repeatedly fail. It can help reframe distress in terms of **energy depletion and perceptual mismatch**, rather than personal weakness.

Potentiology should always be applied **alongside**, never **in place of**, evidence-based assessment, diagnosis, and treatment.


### 8.2 <u>For Educators & Researchers</u>:

Potentiology is intended as a **theoretical and exploratory cognitive model**, not a validated educational or scientific instrument. It may be useful for **conceptual analysis, comparative theory, and hypothesis generation**, but it should not be presented as established psychological fact.

Educators and researchers may use Potentiology to examine **modes of perception, evaluative bias, energy depletion, and environmental fit**, especially in interdisciplinary contexts such as cognitive science, systems theory, or human–machine interaction. However, empirical claims drawn from the model must be **clearly labeled as speculative** unless independently validated.

Potentiology should be treated as a **framework for structured thinking**, not as a replacement for experimentally grounded models or standardized pedagogical tools.


### 8.3 <u>For Hobbyists & General Users</u>:

Potentiology is a **self-exploratory and explanatory framework**, not a test, label, or measure of worth. Types describe **how perception and evaluation tend to operate**, not intelligence, maturity, or success.

Use the model to understand **patterns of satisfaction, burnout, and preference**, not to box yourself or others into rigid identities. People can and do operate outside their dominant functions, often at an energy cost.

Potentiology works best as a **tool for reflection**, not comparison. Treat it as a map for understanding tendencies, not a rulebook for judging behavior.

# $\fbox{POTENTIOLOGY}$



## 1. Introduction



## 2. Terminologies

- **Function:** Shorter term for *cognitive function*.
- **Cognitive function:** Mode of perception with a direction of focus.
- **Subject:** Conscious entity which perceives the *object*.
- **Object:** Content of consciousness which is being perceived by *subject*.
- **Ego:** Center of consciousness which *selects*, *integrates*, *organizes*, and *identifies* experiences for the subject.
- **Suppressed:** Consciously holding back something.
- **Repressed:** Unconsciously blocked from awareness.
- **Seed:** The point on timeline from where a function starts fresh after previous crash.
- **Crash:** A temporary shutdown of a function caused by sustained conflict with its opposing function domain, leading to loss of evaluative authority by primary function.



## 3. Function Domains


### 3.1 <u>Experiencer (X)</u>:

#### 3.1.1 Definition:
*"**Experience** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object **concretely**, as an **experience**."*

#### 3.1.2 Description:
Experience is **concrete** perception, where the object is perceived as it is in **concrete form**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will take the perception as a **matter of fact**. It won't seek to notice any pattern, logic, or value in it. For example, a subject perceives a printer printing pages using an experiencer function. It will say, *"Okay, so printer prints pages. It could be used in printing pages as per requirement."* It doesn't seek to understand what problem a printer could solve, how it works mechanically, or what moral values it might hold. For an experiencer, its just the input and output he experienced.


### 3.2 <u>Abstraction (A)</u>:

#### 3.2.1 Definition:
*"**Abstraction** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **latent patterns**."*

#### 3.2.2 Description:
Abstraction is **pattern** based perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **latent patterns**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will understand the **existing** or **potential patterns** related to it. Taking same example as previous, a subject perceives a printer printing pages using an abstraction function. It will say, *"There are millions of newspapers printed each day, so news publishers must be spending a lot on their maintenance. That could be why their budgets are so high."* It doesn't see the object or focus of consciousness as something concrete, but something explaining or creating patterns.


### 3.3 <u>Logic (L)</u>:

#### 3.3.1 Definition:
*"**Logic** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **logical properties**."*

#### 3.3.2 Description:
Logic is **mechanical** perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **logical properties**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will see that in form of **logical connections**. Taking the same printer example, if the subject perceives a printer printing pages using a logic function. It will say, *"Printer prints pages? How is that? What's going on within it? What kind of components is it using? How are they inter-connected?"* It sees the object as something with **logical properties**, governing its nature, noticing its logical details first.


### 3.4 <u>Morality (M)</u>:

#### 3.4.1 Definition:
*"**Morality** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **moral values**."*

#### 3.4.2 Description:
Morality is value-based perception, where the object is perceived in terms of moral values. If using it the subject looks at something, it will see that in form of moral values. Consider the same printer example from previous examples, if the subject perceives a printer printing pages using a moral function. It will say, *"Such an incredible innovative piece made by someone is what we together are taking leverage of. We should similarly strive to contribute to society, as its a good virtue."* It sees the object as something that holds some values in it, or displays moral values in some way.



## 4. Directions For Functions


### 4.1 <u>Subjective (Sbj)</u>:

#### 4.1.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective functions**, the subject evaluates the object with reference to the **available impressions** of target function domain with the **subject**. This perception is then merged into existing impressions as a single unit, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

#### 4.1.2 Description:


### 4.2 <u>Objective (Obj)</u>:

#### 4.2.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective functions**, the subject evaluates the object with reference to the **available details** of target function domain about the **object**. This perception **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those details, thus **dependent** on object."*

#### 4.2.2 Description:



## 5. Cognitive Functions


### 5.1 <u>Subjective Experiencer (SbjX)</u>:

#### 5.1.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective experiencer** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **concrete impressions** with the **subject**. This experience is then merged into existing impressions about experiences as a single experience, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

#### 5.1.2 Description:


### 5.2 <u>Objective Experiencer (ObjX)</u>:

#### 5.2.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective experiencer** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **concrete details** about the **object**. This experience **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those experiences, thus **dependent** on object."*

#### 5.2.2 Description:


### 5.3 <u>Subjective Abstraction (SbjA)</u>:

#### 5.3.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective abstraction** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **abstract impressions** with the **subject**. This abstract is then merged into existing impressions about patterns as a single abstract, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

#### 5.3.2 Description:


### 5.4 <u>Objective Abstraction (ObjA)</u>:

#### 5.4.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective abstraction** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **abstract details** about the **object**. This abstraction **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those patterns, thus **dependent** on object."*

#### 5.4.2 Description:


### 5.5 <u>Subjective Logician (SbjL)</u>:

#### 5.5.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective logician** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **logical impressions** with the **subject**. This logic is then merged into existing impressions as a single logic, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

#### 5.5.2 Description:


### 5.6 <u>Objective Logician (ObjL)</u>:

#### 5.6.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective logician** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **logical details** about the **object**. This logic **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those logical properties, thus **dependent** on object."*

#### 5.6.2 Description:


### 5.7 <u>Subjective Moral (SbjM)</u>:

#### 5.7.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective moral** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **moral impressions** with the **subject**. This value is then merged into existing impressions about morality as a single unit, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

#### 5.7.2 Description:


### 5.8 <u>Objective Moral (ObjM)</u>:

#### 5.8.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective moral** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **moral details** about the **object**. This morality **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those morals, thus **dependent** on object."*

#### 5.8.2 Description:



## 6. Positioning System


### 6.1 <u>Realms</u>:

#### 6.1.1 Positive:
"***Positive realm** contains the four cognitive functions which ego **takes into its consideration** for evaluation of object.*"

#### 6.1.2 Negative:
"***Negative realm** contains the four cognitive functions which ego **continuously devalues** from its consideration for evaluation of object.*"


### 6.2 <u>Identifying Functions</u>:

#### 6.2.1 Primary function:
*"**Primary function** consumes the **least mental energy**, thus ego is naturally drawn towards it for **longest duration** of time from seed, though ego has choice to go with or against tendencies. It acts as the **first lens** to perceive from."*

#### 6.2.2 Secondary function:
*"**Secondary function** consumes **comparatively more** mental energy than primary function, but less than repressed function. Its tendency comes after perception is evaluated and **passed** from primary function. When engaged alongside the primary function, the secondary increases **total mental energy** expenditure and shortens sustainable runtime."*

#### 6.2.3 Repressed function:
*"**Repressed function** consumes most energy when chosen as mode of perception by ego. It has **lowest runtime** tendency after seed, and primary function actively **suppresses** it until its own crash."*



## 7. Representation


### 7.1 <u>Rules</u>:

1. Direction of secondary and repressed functions are same, and opposite to that of primary's.
2. Below is the table showing corresponding possible secondary and repressed domains for each primary domain:

| Primary Function Domain | Secondary Function Domain | Repressed Function Domain |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| X                       | L, M                      | H                         |
| H                       | L, M                      | X                         |
| L                       | X, H                      | M                         |
| M                       | X, H                      | L                         |

3. Each type is expressed with 3 fixed letters.
4. First letter of a type tells about direction of primary function (**S**/**O**).
5. Second letter tells about the domain of primary function.
6. Third letter tells about the domain of secondary function.


### 7.2 <u>Example</u>:

$$ \text{Type = } SbjMX $$

- First letter is direction of primary function as **subjective (Sbj)**.
- Second letter is the domain of primary function i.e. **morality (M)** and thus function is **subjective morality (SbjM)**.
- Third letter is the domain of secondary function i.e. **experience (X)** but directed opposite to primary function's direction, making it **objective experience (ObjX)**.
- This example profile yields the type **SbjMX** which as per functional definition maps closely to ***IF(S)*** in classic Jungian typology, ***ISFP*** in MBTI, and ***ESI*** in socionics.

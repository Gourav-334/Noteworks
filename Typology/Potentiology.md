# $\fbox{POTENTIOLOGY}$



## 1. Introduction



## 2. Terminologies

- **Function:** Shorter term for *cognitive function*.
- **Cognitive function:** Mode of perception with a direction of focus.
- **Subject:** Conscious entity which perceives the *object*.
- **Object:** Content of consciousness which is being perceived by **subject**.
- **Ego:** Center of consciousness which **selects**, **integrates**, **organizes**, and **identifies** experiences for the subject.
- **Suppressed:** Consciously holding back something.
- **Repressed:** Unconsciously blocked from awareness.
- **Seed:** The point on timeline from where a function starts fresh after previous crash.
- **Crash:** Temporary shutdown of a function against its opposite function.

#### 5.8.2 Description:



## 6. Positioning System


### 6.1 <u>Realms</u>:

#### 6.1.1 Positive:
"***Positive realm** contains the four cognitive functions which ego **takes into its consideration** for evaluation of object.*"

#### 6.1.2 Negative:
"***Negative realm** contains the four cognitive functions which ego **completely discards** from its consideration for evaluation of object.*"


### 6.2 <u>Identifying Functions</u>:

#### 6.2.1 Primary function:
*"**Primary function** consumes the **least mental energy**, thus ego is naturally drawn towards it for **longest duration** of time from seed, though ego has choice to go with or against tendencies. It acts as the **first lens** to perceive from."*

#### 6.2.2 Secondary function:
*"**Secondary function** consumes **comparatively more** mental energy than primary function, but less than repressed function. Its tendency comes after perception is evaluated and **passed** from primary function. If combined with primary function, overall energy consumption takes their **combined time**."*

#### 6.2.3 Repressed function:
*"**Repressed function** consumes most energy when chosen as mode of perception by ego. It has **lowest runtime** tendency after seed, and primary function actively **suppresses** it until its own crash."*



## 7. Representation


### 7.1 <u>Rules</u>:

1. Direction of secondary and repressed functions are same, and opposite to that of primary's.
2. Below is the table showing corresponding possible secondary and repressed domains for each primary domain:

| Primary Function Domain | Secondary Function Domain | Repressed Function Domain |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| P                       | L, M                      | H                         |
| H                       | L, M                      | P                         |
| L                       | P, H                      | M                         |
| M                       | P, H                      | L                         |

3. Each type is expressed with 3 fixed letters.
4. First letter of a type tells about direction of primary function (**S**/**O**).
5. Second letter tells about the domain of primary function.
6. Third letter tells about the domain of secondary function.


### 7.2 <u>Example</u>:

$$ \text{Type = } SMP $$

- First letter is direction of primary function as **subjective (S)**.
- Second letter is the domain of primary function i.e. **morality (M)** and thus function is **subjective morality (SM)**.
- Third letter is the domain of secondary function i.e. **perception (P)** but directed opposite to primary function's direction, making it **objective perception (OP)**.
- This example profile yields the type **SMP** which as per functional definition maps closely to ***IF(S)*** in classic Jungian typology, ***ISFP*** in MBTI, and ***ESI*** in socionics.

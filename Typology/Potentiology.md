# $\fbox{POTENTIOLOGY}$



## 1. Introduction



## 2. Terminologies

- **Function:** Shorter term for *cognitive function*.
- **Cognitive function:** Mode of perception with a direction of focus.
- **Subject:** Conscious entity which perceives the *object*.
- **Object:** Content of consciousness which is being perceived by *subject*.
- **Ego:** Center of consciousness which *selects*, *integrates*, *organizes*, and *identifies* experiences for the subject.
- **Suppressed:** Consciously holding back something.
- **Repressed:** Unconsciously blocked from awareness.
- **Seed:** The point on timeline from where a function starts fresh after previous crash.
- **Crash:** A temporary shutdown of a function caused by sustained conflict with its opposing function domain, leading to loss of evaluative authority by primary function.
- **Impression:** A compressed, internally stored representation of repeated perceptions within a domain.
- **Leakage:** Conscious or unconscious use of a cognitive function that belongs to negative realm, with cost of high mental energy consumption.



## 3. Function Domains


### 3.1 <u>Experiencer (X)</u>:

#### 3.1.1 Definition:
*"**Experience** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object **concretely**, as an **experience**."*

![X](./media/x.png)

#### 3.1.2 Description:
Experience is **concrete** perception, where the object is perceived as it is in **concrete form**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will take the perception as a **matter of fact**. It won't seek to notice any pattern, logic, or value in it. For example, a subject perceives a printer printing pages using an experiencer function. It will say, *"Okay, so printer prints pages. It could be used in printing pages as per requirement."* It doesn't seek to understand what problem a printer could solve, how it works mechanically, or what moral values it might hold. For an experiencer, its just the input and output he experienced.


### 3.2 <u>Abstraction (A)</u>:

#### 3.2.1 Definition:
*"**Abstraction** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **latent patterns**."*

![A](./media/a.png)

#### 3.2.2 Description:
Abstraction is **pattern** based perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **latent patterns**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will understand the **existing** or **potential patterns** related to it. Taking same example as previous, a subject perceives a printer printing pages using an abstraction function. It will say, *"There are millions of newspapers printed each day, so news publishers must be spending a lot on their maintenance. That could be why their budgets are so high."* It doesn't see the object or focus of consciousness as something concrete, but something explaining or creating patterns.


### 3.3 <u>Logic (L)</u>:

#### 3.3.1 Definition:
*"**Logic** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **logical properties**."*

![L](./media/l.png)

#### 3.3.2 Description:
Logic is **mechanical** perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **logical properties**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will see that in form of **logical connections**. Taking the same printer example, if the subject perceives a printer printing pages using a logic function. It will say, *"Printer prints pages? How is that? What's going on within it? What kind of components is it using? How are they inter-connected?"* It sees the object as something with **logical properties**, governing its nature, noticing its logical details first.


### 3.4 <u>Morality (M)</u>:

#### 3.4.1 Definition:
*"**Morality** is a domain of cognitive functions in which the subject perceives the object in terms of **moral values**."*

![M](./media/m.png)

#### 3.4.2 Description:
Morality is **value-based** perception, where the object is perceived in terms of **moral values**. If using it the subject looks at something, it will see that in form of **moral values**. Consider the same printer example from previous examples, if the subject perceives a printer printing pages using a moral function. It will say, *"Such an incredible innovative piece made by someone is what we together are taking leverage of. We should similarly strive to contribute to society, as its a good virtue."* It sees the object as something that **holds some value** in it, or displays moral values in some way.



## 4. Directions For Functions


### 4.1 <u>Subjective (Sbj)</u>:

#### 4.1.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective functions**, the subject evaluates the object with reference to the **available impressions** of target function domain with the **subject**. This perception is then merged into existing impressions as a single unit, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![Sbj](./media/sbj.png)

#### 4.1.2 Description:
Subject uses subjective function to understand the object by **recalling** their **past perceptions**. These perceptions exist in a **singular form** as an impression. And this new perceptions finally merges into a **single impression** after being understood, expanding understanding with the particular function. This continues with many perceptions and the subject keeps **accumulating new data**, increasing the overall size of unit impression. The subject could later reflect upon this impression **without** having to depend on an active stimulus from object. And because the subject matches object to each content present in impression, it is usually processes **slower** than objective functions.


### 4.2 <u>Objective (Obj)</u>:

#### 4.2.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective functions**, the subject evaluates the object with reference to the **available details** of target function domain about the **object**. This perception **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those details, thus **dependent** on object."*

![Obj](./media/obj.png)

#### 4.2.2 Description:
Subject uses objective functions to understand the object by **noticing the details** that object possesses. These perceptions are seen as something **fresh and new**, not necessarily to do with past perceptions. It is **not** stored as a unit impression, instead it is just adaptation to the object's details **temporarily**, until the subject receives **active stimulus** from the object. After this stimulus ends, there is no use of it. Its not that the subject may not value what he learned from objective details, but he **won't reflect** upon it if he perceives newer objects. And because the subject isolates object as a system, it usually processes **faster** than subjective functions.



## 5. Cognitive Functions


### 5.1 <u>Subjective Experiencer (SbjX)</u>:

#### 5.1.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective experiencer** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **concrete impressions** with the **subject**. This experience is then merged into existing impressions about experiences as a single experience, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjX](./media/sbjx.png)

#### 5.1.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjX** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that experience makes sense to his existing impression of experiences. It accepts the experience if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the experience if it seems different from their experience. But they might still acquire newer experiences through **ObjX** leakages. Example for **SbjX** usage would be, a person understands why one of the two newly brought printers works as the previous one used to be, but won't prefer a printer with different controls. Or even after witnessing its working, he would prefer using the printer with known controls. But he will accept it if there is no other choice, or an **ObjX** leakage occurs.


### 5.2 <u>Objective Experiencer (ObjX)</u>:

#### 5.2.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective experiencer** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **concrete details** about the **object**. This experience **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those experiences, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjX](./media/objx.png)

#### 5.2.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjX** function, it perceives the object and notices the concrete details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those experiences. It is open to adapting newer experiences when required even if they don't align with personal experiences. But they might still form impressions through **SbjX** leakages. Example for **ObjX** usage would be, a person sees the difference in two newly brought printers with differing controls. He will be drawn towards using the printer with different controls than the existing one if it is situationally better to use. But he will use the printer with known working if there is none other available, or a **SbjX** leakage occurs.


### 5.3 <u>Subjective Abstraction (SbjA)</u>:

#### 5.3.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective abstraction** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **abstract impressions** with the **subject**. This abstract is then merged into existing impressions about patterns as a single abstract, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjA](./media/sbja.png)

#### 5.3.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjA** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that abstraction makes sense to his existing impression of abstracts. It accepts the abstract if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the experience if it seems different from their abstraction. But they might still acquire newer abstractions through **ObjA** leakages. Example for **SbjA** usage would be, a person sees a new printer. He already possesses abstract model for previous printers, with different controls. He will look at its controls, and figures out how they must work by referring to those abstractions. And if it doesn't work, he either interprets the printer as something else, or looks for other abstract patterns under pressure, or due to **ObjA** leakage.


### 5.4 <u>Objective Abstraction (ObjA)</u>:

#### 5.4.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective abstraction** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **abstract details** about the **object**. This abstraction **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those patterns, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjA](./media/obja.png)

#### 5.4.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjA** function, it perceives the object and notices the abstract details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those patterns. It is open to adapting newer abstractions when required even if they don't align with personal abstract understanding. But they might still form impressions through **SbjA** leakages. Example for **ObjA** usage would be, a person sees a new printer. He looks for the abstract details present in the printer itself, and understands the pattern its controls form altogether. Then he will try running it as per the pattern he figured out in its controls. If it doesn't work, he will look for a different pattern in it instead of interpreting it as something else. But he will use past impressions if not able to figure out for too long, or through **SbjA** leakage.


### 5.5 <u>Subjective Logician (SbjL)</u>:

#### 5.5.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective logician** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **logical impressions** with the **subject**. This logic is then merged into existing impressions as a single logic, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjL](./media/sbjl.png)

#### 5.5.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjL** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that logic makes sense to his existing impression of logic. It accepts the logical property if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the logic if it seems different from their logic. But they might still acquire newer logic through **ObjL** leakages. Example for **SbjL** usage would be, a person sees a new printer in office, and to make sense of its working he checks how it works within. But will reject it if that doesn't match his understanding of logic, or can't figure out its working through existing logical understanding. He might still adapt to work with printer's own logic if there is no other choice, or an **ObjA** leakage occurs.


### 5.6 <u>Objective Logician (ObjL)</u>:

#### 5.6.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective logician** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **logical details** about the **object**. This logic **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those logical properties, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjL](./media/objl.png)

#### 5.6.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjL** function, it perceives the object and notices the logical details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those logic. It is open to adapting newer logic when required even if they don't align with personal logical understanding. But they might still form impressions through **SbjL** leakages. Example for **ObjL** usage would be, a person sees a new printer. He looks for the logical properties present in the printer itself to make sense of how they work. If it doesn't work, they might then try figuring it out as per how they must work using their personal understanding of logical properties through **SbjL** logic.


### 5.7 <u>Subjective Moral (SbjM)</u>:

#### 5.7.1 Definition:
*"Using **subjective moral** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **moral impressions** with the **subject**. This value is then merged into existing impressions about morality as a single unit, and could be reflected upon, **independent** of object."*

![SbjM](./media/sbjm.png)

#### 5.7.2 Description:
When a subject uses **SbjM** function, it perceives the object and reflects upon how that value makes sense to his existing impression of morality. It accepts the value if it makes sense with impression, and might reject the value if it seems different from their morals. But they might still acquire newer values through **ObjM** leakages. Example for **SbjM** usage would be, a person is considering buying a new printer. And the company which manufactured it is known for certain tactics to market their products. Now he will not buy it if his past moral impressions take those tactics as immoral. But he might buy if an important work has to be done and there is no other choice, or an **ObjM** leakage occurs with no one else using it in same office has any problem.


### 5.8 <u>Objective Moral (ObjM)</u>:

#### 5.8.1 Definition:
*"Using **objective moral** function, the subject evaluates the object with reference to available **moral details** about the **object**. This morality **pulls** the subject towards **mentally adapting** to those morals, thus **dependent** on object."*

![ObjM](./media/objm.png)

#### 5.8.2 Description:
When a subject uses **ObjM** function, it perceives the object and notices the moral details with it, and then seeks to mentally adapt to those values. It is open to adapting newer values when required even if they don't align with personal morals. But they might still form impressions through **SbjM** leakages. Example for **ObjM** usage would be, a person considers buying new printer. And the company uses questionable marketing tactics like previous example. Now he will check if everyone else in the office who would be using it has any problem with that. If no, he will proceed to buy it and adapt to group's morals. But he might reject it if other users have problem with it, or a **SbjM** leakage occurs.



## 6. Positioning System


### 6.1 <u>Realms</u>:

#### 6.1.1 Positive:
"***Positive realm** contains the four cognitive functions which ego **takes into its consideration** for evaluation of object.*"

#### 6.1.2 Negative:
"***Negative realm** contains the four cognitive functions which ego **continuously devalues** from its consideration for evaluation of object.*"


### 6.2 <u>Identifying Functions</u>:

#### 6.2.1 Primary function:
*"**Primary function** consumes the **least mental energy**, thus ego is naturally drawn towards it for **longest duration** of time from seed, though ego has choice to go with or against tendencies. It acts as the **first lens** to perceive from."*

#### 6.2.2 Secondary function:
*"**Secondary function** consumes **comparatively more** mental energy than primary function, but less than repressed function. Its tendency comes after perception is evaluated and **passed** from primary function. When engaged alongside the primary function, the secondary increases **total mental energy** expenditure and shortens sustainable runtime."*

#### 6.2.3 Repressed function:
*"**Repressed function** consumes most energy when chosen as mode of perception by ego. It has **lowest runtime** tendency after seed, and primary function actively **suppresses** it until its own crash."*



## 7. Representation


### 7.1 <u>Rules</u>:

1. Direction of secondary and repressed functions are same, and opposite to that of primary's.
2. Below is the table showing corresponding possible secondary and repressed domains for each primary domain:

| Primary Function Domain | Secondary Function Domain | Repressed Function Domain |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| X                       | L, M                      | A                         |
| A                       | L, M                      | X                         |
| L                       | X, A                      | M                         |
| M                       | X, A                      | L                         |

3. Each type is expressed with 3 fixed letters.
4. First letter of a type tells about direction of primary function (**Sbj**/**Obj**).
5. Second letter tells about the domain of primary function.
6. Third letter tells about the domain of secondary function.


### 7.2 <u>Example</u>:

$$ \text{Type = } SbjMX $$

- First letter is direction of primary function as **subjective (Sbj)**.
- Second letter is the domain of primary function i.e. **morality (M)** and thus function is **subjective morality (SbjM)**.
- Third letter is the domain of secondary function i.e. **experience (X)** but directed opposite to primary function's direction, making it **objective experience (ObjX)**.
- This example profile yields the type **SbjMX** which as per functional definition maps closely to ***IF(S)*** in classic Jungian typology, ***ISFP*** in MBTI, and ***ESI*** in socionics.

| Type | +ve Realm Runtime Energy Consumption | -ve Realm Runtime Energy Consumption |
| :--: | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| ISFP | SbjM < ObjX < SbjA < ObjL            | ObjL < SbjX < ObjA < SbjL            |


### 7.3 <u>Mapping Equivalents</u>:

| Potentiology | Classic Jungian | MBTI | Socionics |
| :----------: | :-------------: | :--: | :-------: |
|    SbjXL     |      IS(T)      | ISTJ |    SLI    |
|    SbjXM     |      IS(F)      | ISFJ |    SEI    |
|    ObjLX     |      ET(S)      | ESTJ |    LSE    |
|    ObjMX     |      EF(S)      | ESFJ |    ESE    |
|    SbjLX     |      IT(S)      | ISTP |    LSI    |
|    SbjMX     |      IF(S)      | ISFP |    ESI    |
|    ObjXL     |      ES(T)      | ESTP |    SLE    |
|    ObjXM     |      ES(F)      | ESFP |    SEE    |
|    SbjAM     |      IN(F)      | INFJ |    IEI    |
|    SbjMA     |      IF(N)      | INFP |    EII    |
|    ObjMA     |      EF(N)      | ENFJ |    EIE    |
|    ObjAM     |      EN(F)      | ENFP |    IEE    |
|    SbjAL     |      IN(T)      | INTJ |    ILI    |
|    SbjLA     |      IT(N)      | INTP |    LII    |
|    ObjLA     |      ET(N)      | ENTJ |    LIE    |
|    ObjAL     |      EN(T)      | ENTP |    ILE    |


### 7.4 <u>Evaluation Suggestions</u>:

- Look for how long someone can use a particular function comfortably.
- And what the person does after a crash, during the recovery period.
- These might not be shown outward necessarily, and the subject might be very good at using or controlling it.
- For example, an ***SbjAM*** might be good at sports when recovering from crash while using ***ObjX***.
- This can be known by asking the exact questions a person wants to be asked.
- For example, a ***ObjL*** might be very much interested in telling how they handle logical situations at work place effectively.
- Questions must be kept within a short radius of time, usually within 1-2 years, because types are dynamic and there is no guarantee for them to be fixed.
- Method can be either descriptive, or analytical based on objectively provable facts.
- People who have been recently diagnosed with any form of trauma must be evaluated carefully and with respect to navigate through anomalies.

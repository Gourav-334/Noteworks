# <u>Chapter 2</u>: MODELS





## **Topic - 1: Waterfall Model**

### <u>Introduction</u>

![Waterfall Model](./media/image5.png)

- Introduced by Winston Royce in 1970.


### <u>Phases</u>

#### i. Requirement analysis & specification:

- This phase is about ***"what"*** and not ***"how"***.
- Also SRS document is created in the same phase, as the name itself says.

#### ii. Design phase:

- This phase deals with designing the software.
- Here, another document called **Software Design Document (SDD)** is made.

#### iii. Implementation & unit testing:

- Codes are also continuously modified before & during testing.
- At last, developers check the execution flow for performance improvement purposes.

#### iv. Integration & system testing:

- Integrated testing to see how each individual module interacts with each other.

#### v. Operation & maintenance phase:

- Performed based on feedbacks by customers.


### <u>Use Cases</u>

- Requirements are rarely subject to change.
- Project is short.
- When resources are available readily.


### <u>Advantages</u>

- Easy to understand.
- Minimal resource requirements.
- Requirements are rarely subject to change.
- Reliable order of phases.
- Trackable by project manager.


### <u>Disadvantages</u>

- Not suitable for complex projects.
- Not responsive to frequent changes in requirement.
- Tough to make changes in already passed phases.



## **Topic - 2: Rapid Application Development Model (RAD)**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- RAD believes that software can be constructed in a very less time if we keep certain things in our mind.

#### Things to keep in mind:

- Gathering information from focus groups.
- Early design prototyping.
- Early prototype testing.
- Using automatic code generation tools.
- Re-using old software components instead.
- A strict schedule.
- Little to no formality in team communication.

### <u>Phases</u>

1. **<u>Business modelling</u>:** Shows how data/information will flow through business entities.
2. **<u>Data modelling</u>:** Relation among various attributes of all business entities are drawn.
3. **<u>Process modelling</u>:** It is defined how operations on data will affect other entities involved.
4. **<u>Application generation</u>:** Software is coded.
5. **Testing & turnover**


### <u>Use Cases</u>

- When project has to be developed in a short span of time, typically in few months.
- Requirements are already known.
- Project is not risky.


### <u>Advantages</u>

- Flexible for change.
- Faster development time.


### <u>Disadvantages</u>

- Requires highly skilled people.
- Not good with projects having high technical risks.



## **Topic - 3: Spiral Model**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- Proposed by Boehm.
- Converges both linear & iterative form of model.
- It focuses on making modifications on software in new versions.
- Earlier, only prototype models are produced but later proper modifications are added using spiral model.

### <u>Phases</u>

1. **Objective setting**
2. **<u>Risk assessment & reduction</u>:** Various alternatives are evaluated.
3. **Development & validation**
4. **<u>Planning</u>:** Project is reviewed & it is decided if spiral needs to be repeated.


### <u>Use Cases</u>

- Fast version delivery.
- Large project.
- Complex projects.
- Unexpected subjects to change.


### <u>Advantages</u>

- Has a dedicated phase for analyzing & addressing risks.
- Can handle large & complex projects.


### <u>Disadvantages</u>

- Total project cost can be very high.
- Experts are required for each phase.
- Not good with small projects.

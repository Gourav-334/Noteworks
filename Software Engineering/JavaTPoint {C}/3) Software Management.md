- **PERT** stands for **Program Evaluation Review Technique**.
- Developed by US Navy in 1950s.

- Some tasks or series of tasks are being performed parallelly as shown above.

### <u>Logic Network</u>

- Similar to Gantt chart, only difference being that the series of activities are shown on the same line.

- Breaks down the product into smaller & understandable parts to focus on.


### <u>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</u>

- Similar to **product breakdown structure**.
- **<u>PMBOK</u>:** Project Management Body Of Knowledge
- PMBOK is the smallest & thus the unbreakable unit/token in the graphical representation of WBS.
- **Top-down approach** deals with breaking down the larger goals into smaller tasks.
- **Bottom-up approach** deals with joining small tasks set into larger goals which make up the whole project.

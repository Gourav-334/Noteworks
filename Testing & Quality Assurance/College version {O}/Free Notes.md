### <u>Performance Testing</u>

- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Regression testing
- Compatibility testing
	- Device compatibility
	- Browser compatibility
	- Platform compatibility
- Endurance testing
- User acceptance testing
- Beta testing
- Black-box testing


### <u>Black-Box Testing Techniques</u>

1. Boundary-value analysis
2. Equivalent-class partition
3. Decision table
4. Error guessing
5. Error handling
6. Cause-effect
7. State-transition
8. Use case testing

#### Tools:

- Selenium
- Jmeter
- QTP


### <u>White-Box Testing</u>

#### Advantages:

- Expert feedback
- Risk avoidance
- Quality improvement

#### Disadvantages:

- Cost (to human resources)

#### Types:

1. Penetration testing
2. Path testing
3. Mutation testing
4. Loop testing
5. Unit testing
6. Integration testing


### <u>Cyclomatic Complexity</u>

| Cyclomatic Complexity | Level                       |
| :-------------------: | :-------------------------- |
|         1-10          | Low (effort, cost, time)    |
|         11-20         | Medium (effort, cost, time) |
|         21-30         | High (effort, cost, time)   |
|       31-ABOVE        | Highest                     |

- Independent path
- Nodes
- Edges
- Region (bounded)

### <u>Object-Oriented Testing</u>

- **<u>OOT</u>:** A method in which we can check all concepts of OOP.
- It is done after completion of conventional testing.
- Mainly applicable on large scale projects.

#### Disadvantages:

- Complex issues
- Can't perform automation testing

#### Levels:

1. Algorithmic level
2. Class-level testing
3. Interclass-level testing
4. Cluster-level testing
5. System-level testing
6. Regression testing

>**<u>QUESTIONS</u>:**
>1. Disadvantages of conventional testing.
>2. Disadvantages of OOT.

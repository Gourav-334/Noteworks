# $\fbox{BASIC ELECTRONICS}$





## **Chapter - 1: Electronics Foundations**

- **Electricity:** Behavior of electric charges under electric fields.
- Electrical affects arise from charge imbalance & energy gradients.
- **Electric charge ($Q$):** Property of particles causing them to experience electrical force.
- **One electron charge ($e$):** $e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$
- **Electric current ($I$):** Rate of flow of electric charge. ($I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$)
- Direction of current is opposite to electron's flow.
- **Electric potential ($V$):** Energy per unit charge at a point in circuit.
- **Voltage / Potential difference ($V$):** Difference between two electric potentials.
- **Electrical charge ($W$):** Energy transferred when potential difference changes. ($V=\frac{W}{Q}$)
- **Power ($P$):** Rate of energy transfer. ($P=VI$)
- **Ohm's law:** Voltage is directly proportional to current. ($V=IR$)
- **Kirchhoff's current law (KCL):** Sum of currents at a node is $0$ (fast distribution from node).
- **Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL):** Sum of voltages in a closed loop is $0$.
- **Direct current (DC):** Constant direction & magnitude.
- **Alternating current (AC):** Direction reverses periodically.



## **Chapter - 2: Passive Components & Network**

- **Passive components:** Does not generate energy (register, capacitor, inductor).
- **Register ($R$):** Opposes flow of current by converting electrical energy into heat.
- **Capacitor ($C$):** Stores energy in electric field (two conductive plate + dielectric in mid). ($Q=CV$)
- **Inductor ($L$):** Stores energy in magnetic field (coil of wire). ($V=L \frac{dI}{dt}$)
- **Series connection:** Same current across / voltages add.
- **Parallel connection:** Same voltage across / currents add.
- **Time constant ($\tau$):** Response speed
- **RC circuit:** Capacitor charging and discharging ($C$ resists change in $V$). ($\tau =RC$)
- **RL circuit:** Inductor current rise and decay ($L$ resists change in $I$). ($\tau = \frac{L}{R}$)
- **Frequency response:** Capacitors = $\uparrow$ freq. signals & Inductors = $\downarrow$ freq. signals



## **Chapter - 3: Semiconductor Physics**

- **Charge carriers:** High in conductors, low in insulators, controlled in semiconductors.
- **Band:** Equilibrium energy arising from merging of each atom's energy.
- **Valence band:** Tightly held electrons.
- **Conduction band:** Loosely held electrons.
- **Bandgap ($E_9$):** Region without energy.
- **Intrinsic semiconductor:** Semiconductor made purely from one element ($n_{electrons}=n_{holes}$).
- **Hole:** Absence of electrons, considered positive charge (for electrons' behavior to it).

## **Chapter - 1: Boolean Logic**

- $\downarrow\text{Noise margin} \propto \;\uparrow\text{Reliability}$
- **Idempotent law:** Repeating a condition changes nothing.
- **Complement law:** A condition and its negation can not co-exist.
- **De Morgan's law:** Constraints can be re-written, not changed.
- Transistors act as switches here.



## **Chapter - 2: Combinational Logic**

- **Combinational circuit:** Circuit where output depends only on inputs. ($Y=f(X_1,X_2,...,X_N)$)
- **Sum of products (SOP):** OR of AND terms
- **Product of sums (POS):** AND of OR terms
- **Karnaugh's map (K-map):** Visual tool for compressing Boolean expression.
- **Don't care conditions ($X$):** Input conditions that will never occur.



## **Chapter - 3: Arithmetic Logic**

### <u>Planned Controls</u>

- Always remember which gear the car is currently switched to.
- Switch gear if the state of motion for car changes, as per aliases of gears.
- When climbing up the hill, gear down by 1.
- When coming down the hill, gear up by 1.


### <u>Emergency Controls</u>

- When engine sounds stuck - **GEAR UP**
- When engine doesn't produce sound - **GEAR DOWN**



## **Topic - 3: Navigation Guidance**

### <u>General</u>

- Avoid going off-tracks, they **slow down** & **damage** the vehicle.


### <u>Straight Drag</u>

- For straighter part of the roads, keep **gearing up** until **2 seconds** before **acute drift**.
- Then for **2 seconds** before acute turn, slow the vehicle down for drift.


### <u>Drifting</u>

- Always **slow** the vehicle down before the drift.
- Be on the **center** of the road before drifting & in general also.
- For smoother drift, press brakes for once & then apply gas while turning.
- Maximum number of drifts per $90\degree$ is $1$.
- Switch gear to appropriate number as per the current state of car.
- If the guess mismatches (engine stuck/ no sound), then gear up or down accordingly.



## **Topic - 4: Race Events**

- Always practice & improve on tracks before the actual race.



## **Topic - 5: Driver Performance**

### <u>Tips</u>

- Always have a strong focus on far ahead of the road.
- Don't get lost in thoughts, specially on actual races.
- Be alert for next drift & center align to the road.
- After any form of crash, bad judgement, or problem, focus on aligning to center immediately.
- Start relying on engine's sound to change gear, instead of looking on digital meters.
- Keep music off for maximum focus on race.


### <u>Current Weaknesses</u>

- Poor grip on clutch
- Poor break timing
- Poor turning judgement

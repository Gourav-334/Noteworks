HOW ADDICTION WORKS
-------------------

Main
----
In modern world, most people suffer from addictions & addiction can be of any kind. Most common types of addictions includes addiction of alcohol, masturbation/sex, caffeine, junk food etc.

So why does a person performs an addictive activity despite knowing the fact that he/she is addicted? The answer is because its less about being aware about the fact & more about the bodily sensational response to it. High-level addiction occurs when a person has given up on recovering from the addiction. Mid-level addiction is characterized by person being too much compulsive and irritated of his addiction. Low-level addiction occurs when a person compulsively performs his addictive activity thinking its normal, which is not.

Sometimes, a person tries applying all logical facts while the phase of compulsive emotion comes, to perform the addictive activity. And during this phase, a very small number of times the person successfully pulls off from doing the activity. But in actual, there are only two choices. Either perform the activity and get relaxed from the compulsive thoughts, or just resist it forcefully; in which a voice is convincing you to perform the addiction. Choosing the second option might result in irritation & mental pain, but can also be rewarding (depends).

The best method to deal with it is to gradually lower down the rate of the activity; and before that, the sufferer must know whats his threshold before performing it compulsively. Then calculate the rate to lower it down as per personal preference. Also one must consider conditions that trigger these desires (if any). And make a master strategy to strike it down.

One must not see it as a burden, neither ignore it. One must tackle it considering an issue and fight for the good will and God. Because when we are liberated of these addictions, we become spiritually more inclined; as our level of consciousness falls and we become slaves to our body. And to become free of the clutches of our oppressors (the senses), we must not tell them directly about breaking out of the prison, rather plan the escape & gradually execute it under reconnaissance.

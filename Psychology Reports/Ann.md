## **1. Jungian Typology**

As per the Jungian Typology, Ann is a dominant feeler (F), with other competing functions could be intuition (N) & sensing (S). And because the only non-dominant function is thinking (T), we can easily order the order of information processing as F-X-Y-T. To know the order of dominance among N and S would be to consider certain characteristics. For a clear preference to abstract concepts instead of sensory information or experience, we can place N before S in ordering of functions. This provides us order of F-N-S-T. Now I will justify this order with accounts by Ms. Ann herself. First in order at the first line of defense we see F. Ann is clearly a feeler (F) for her constant need for emotional support. Her whole identity is shaped around intense feelings & troubling pasts, which are not formed due to circumstances, but due to natural tendency of brain. This can be proven with the fact that she not just in her childhood, but still in adulthood craves for a lot of attention, emotional needs & lives on edge of melancholy, claiming to love being melancholic & sad (attunment for suffering as romantic). Then second after the information is filtered or observed through emotional lens, they are passed to intuition (N). Intuition as she herself mentioned to be attracted toward abstract concepts & art as a hobby (writing, drawing, etc), which are engagement with creative expression, often abstract. It really matters a lot what one finds interest in to know about personality types. While F & N provide escapism, S takes the filtered information further to reflect on the real needs of world. F and S tend to handle real world needs in form of caring/nursing as she wrote. While the information loses its quality by the time it reaches the thinking (T) function, which is partly holds preference for feelings & emotions on top in exchange for logical or mechanical truths. And because she reserves her emotions within instead of expressing them directly and socially in structured manner, she is drawn inwards & thus typed as Jungian IF(N).

### Type: IF(N)



## **2. Myers-Briggs Type Indicator**

As per the knowledge & conclusion we have gained so far from thorough analysis in Jungian analysis above, we can pipe the same result strongly to MBTI system, making it an INFP type. The ordering of cognitive functions in INFPs are Fi-Ne-Si-Te. Let's go through each information filter one-by-one. Let's start from Fi, which as we discussed in Jungian discussion, is her dominant personality trait, tendency & identity. She takes the raw information daily and filters them through Fi in form of emotional narrative which are often intense, cause her discomfort & make her feel different at the same time. She also takes part in various form of activism actively to advocate & point out morally bad practices (subjective to her). These are raw representation instead of organized addressing or expression of emotions as a Fe dominant person would do. So its clearly Fi, not Fe. Fi dominant people tend to preserve emotion data in them which become too intense over time (I = preserving, E = expressing). Then her processed information as emotions get filtered through Ne, in form of creating expression instead of abstract form of passive studying & reserving the knowledge gained for its own sake. And because intuition is about abstract patterns, trends, prediction, time, etc, the E (in Ne) pushes her to display the same emotional information coming from previous filter in abstract form, in a creative form in real world. After the information has been processed from Fi and Ne, Si reserves the sensory details gained from creative expression & past experience to further repeat & reflect using the Fi-Ne-Si cycle (Te undeveloped). The undeveloped Te causes the information to exhaust in its quality by the time it could reach Te at inferior position. So, its a clear case of INFP (Fi dominant, Ne auxiliary, Si tertiary, Te inferior).

### Type: INFP



## **3. Enneagram & Instinctual Variant**

Her whole identity is painted around being different from the mainstream society, different behavior, shaping of personality through disorders like OCD, ADHD & autism. Ann takes her life and experiences as suffering, or rather a pleasing form of suffering. This is a display of romantic form of bonding with identity while strongly believing to be different, giving a clear type 4 as dominant enneagram type. Type 4s desire to be different in a romantic or dramatic manner. And losing her identity would be a major fear. And for the wing, it would be type 3, as she herself shared her tendency to be perfect in everything to please others, craving for their attention. This because type 3s have desire to be known for their achievements in their social circles. So clearly her enneagram type is 4w3, and tritype comes close to 415 (weak 5 but strong 1 for strong participation in activism in wide scale, aggressively). For her instinctual variant, her focus on preserving her identity at all cost & seeking social harmony/connection with people to refine her emotional experience or write her story in a romantic manner (as a live observer of a story), this would make her a self-preservative (SP) with a blend of social tendency (SO). Social isn't dominant clearly for not having consideration of hierarchy & social dynamics, but just the participation. So its SP/SO.

### Type: 4w3-SP/SO (415)



## **4. Temperament**

Ann shows a very deep world and a strong tendency to experience suffering & her own dark experiences. She is very reflective on her emotions, and tend to reserve them deeply instead of being driven by them. And she is very focused with her reflections (thus intense). This easily provides us a type with dominant melancholic tendency. While phlegmatic types would have been more emotionally stable, tolerant & unwavering from emotions. And choleric people show their emotions in form of anger, frustration & disappointment, and they are more driven towards their goals or objectives. Finally to mention, sanguine people are total opposite of melancholics, with a driven nature and optimistic look on life while staying away from anything that shows the pessimistic side or make them feel uncomfortable. So, she is pure melancholic without any blend.

### Type: Melancholic \[Dominant\]



## **5. Moral Alignment**

Ann's strong participation in various activism, tendency to care for others & take a career related to care taking clearly shows a strong alignment towards good side. And this can be further proven with her self-loathing for thinking she is selfish & putting a moral judgement on self with accusation of not putting others first. Her way of advocacy or characteristics don't describe anything which prefers lawful or unlawful way of gaining objectives or asserting values, so she is clearly neutral. This gives us overall a good neutral personality.

### Type: Good Neutral



>**<u>FINAL VERDICT</u>:
>INFP, 4w3-sp/so (415), Melancholic \[Dominant\], IF(N), Neutral Good

# $\fbox{Chapter 4: LINKED LIST}$





### <u>Facts About Linked List</u>

- May not be stored in consecutive memory location.
- Doubly linked list is represented by 2 arrows between consecutive nodes.
- Operations on linked list: traversing, insertion, deletion, searching.
- Memory representation table is very important to make.
- Self referential structures are structures which point to another same structure.


### <u>Algorithm Complexities</u>

| Operation / type          | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List | Circular Linked List |
| :------------------------ | :----------------: | :----------------: | :------------------- |
| Insert at the begin       |       $O(1)$       |       $O(1)$       | $O(1)$               |
| Insert at the given index |       $O(n)$       |       $O(n)$       | $O(n)$               |
| Insert at the end         |       $O(n)$       |       $O(n)$       | $O(1)$               |
| Delete at the begin       |       $O(1)$       |       $O(1)$       | $O(1)$               |
| Delete at the given index |       $O(n)$       |       $O(n)$       | $O(n)$               |
| Delete the end            |       $O(n)$       |       $O(n)$       | $O(1)$               |
| Searching the element     |       $O(n)$       |       $O(n)$       | $O(n)$               |

# $\fbox{Chapter 1: INFORMATION SECURITY}$





## **Topic - 1: Information System (IS)**

### <u>Introduction</u>

- **<u>Information system</u>:** A system where information is passed, processed & passed on to organizations for their needs.
- It can involve combination of both hardware & software.


### <u>Components Of IS</u>

- Hardware
- Software
- Data
- Procedures
- People


### <u>People Resource</u>

- People resources includes both **end users** & **IS specialists**.
- **<u>End users</u>:** Include customers, salesperson, engineers, clerks, managers etc.
- **<u>IS specialists</u>:** Technical people involved in developing IS.


### <u>Data Resources</u>

#### Types of data:

- **Alphanumeric data**
- **<u>Text data</u>:** Simple sentences & paragraphs
- **Image data**
- **Sound data**

#### Criteria for data:

- **<u>Comprehensiveness</u>:** Enough data about the subject must be present.
- **Non-redundancy**
- **<u>Appropriate structure</u>:** To cut unnecessary computation cost in retrieval.



## **Topic - 2: Types Of IS**

### <u>Introduction</u>

#### Major systems:

- **<u>Executive support system (ESS)</u>:** Used by executives for making strategic decisions.
- **<u>Decision support system (DSS)</u>:** Used by senior managers for decision making.
- **<u>Management information system (MIS)</u>:** Used by managers for achieving operational efficiency.
- **<u>Transaction processing system (TPS)</u>:** Used by workers for basic reporting.

#### Other systems:

- **Enterprise resource planning systems (ERPS)**
- **Expert systems (ESYS)**
- **Online analytical processing (OLAP)**


### <u>Transaction Processing System (TPS)</u>

- Purpose of TPS is to keep record of transactions by the organization.
- For example - Payroll system, billing system, purchasing system, shipping of record etc.
- These transactions may be routine-based or occasional.


### <u>Decision Support System (DSS)</u>

- DSS is used for decision making by junior management team using data.
- The data used can be either external or internal or both.
- It is used when the data is in large amount & thus too complex to analyze without tools or models.


### <u>Executive Support System (ESS)</u>

- ESS is also known as **executive information system (EIS)**.
- It is used by senior management team of the organization.
- Senior management team analyzes summary & makes strategic decisions as per that.
- ESS provides easy-to-view & analyze form of reports, generally graphical representation.


### <u>Management Information System (MIS)</u>

- Similar to TPS & used by management teams.
- Difference is that it is used for for monotonous form of reports.


### <u>Enterprise Resource Planning</u>

- Department specific set of tools, used by companies, mostly MNCs.
- For example - human resource management, customer relationship management, supply chain management etc.


### <u>Expert Systems (ESYS)</u>

- ESYS are used for getting suggestions.
- It makes use of inference engine & knowledge base.
- **<u>Inference base</u>:** Tests made on knowledge base.
- **<u>Knowledge base</u>:** Core database where unrefined raw data are stored.
- Knowledge base is basically the initial source of data.



## **Topic - 3: Development Of Information System**

### <u>System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</u>

### <u>Development Information System</u>

- SDLC also consists of three main information from survey.
- These are - System identification, selection & system planning.
- **<u>System identification</u>:** Identifying the system that organize uses in order to address security inefficiencies later.
- **<u>Selection</u>:** Selecting features to apply on the solution.


### <u>SDLC Phases</u>

#### Analysis:

- Also known as system requirement analysis.
- It is about dismantling whole system into smaller parts & analyzing them.
- This includes knowing about how each of them work & interact with each other.

#### Design:

- Making blueprint to IT team for executing the plan.
